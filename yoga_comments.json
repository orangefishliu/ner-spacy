    "body": "Sure, I can describe it.  Sorry if this is a bit long.  \n\nIn the vipassana retreat, I had a sort of breakthrough quasi-psychedelic experience on the 7th day (with a few smaller experiences in the days leading up to it, including lucid dreaming and hyperreal visual acuity).  It went something like this: without warning, I felt enveloped in a blue \"light\".  I was immersed in a profound (even supernatural) peace and happiness.  A ball of energy seemed to rise up from my perineum/crotch area and spread upwards to my head, seeming to gently force my head back and my mouth to open, as if this energy was exiting, or as if I was receiving something.  A large flower seemed to open up where I sat, stretching from my solar plexus to where my butt touched the floor (something I previously had thought was just a symbolic flourish in eastern religious art, but this seemed to be literally happening).  I ejaculated slightly without orgasming (sorry if that's a little gross or unwanted info).  I was flooded with the understanding that this is a state I or anyone else could experience at any moment, if we so chose, and we could all emerge from our suffering together.  Then the sit ended and the experience was over.\n\nA few years later, I was diagnosed with spinal arthritis, and in the midst of a total freakout, my wife encouraged me to meditate.  I had a full-blown experience, an absolutely ecstatic awakening of unitary consciousness, and a kind of filling up of my body with energy that was radiating from my belly and below.  It was a religio-mystical experience of remembering my true nature (it actually seemed like there was an intuition of a \"voice\" that asked me if I would \"like to remember\").  I was engulfed in all-encompassing love, compassion and forgiveness for everything that exists, and all the while my perception of self and reality seemed to fractal like a mandala.  There was no difference between what was inside and outside of me, eyes open or closed.  Physical pains, old grudges, and difficult memories that arose became gateways into deeper unfolding, and then the pains vanished. It was all love, and it was infinite and safe.\n\nThere was one thing that was particularly weird about this: while it was happening, every time my wife looked at me, she would kind of pass out.  She asked me why that was happening, and to my mind at the time, the answer was apparent; she was unconsciously attuning to my energy, but she was doing so in the way one ordinarily accesses this kind of dreamlike state: by sinking into sleep.  Also, when I spoke to her, my voice seemed to deepen, and I understood that when I typically talk with her (or anyone), it's like I am putting on a mask of personality that is perhaps flimsier than my \"true\" self.\n\nSince then, I've had regular experiences that are similar, but not usually (but sometimes) quite as laden with information; more typically, it's mostly a physical/energetic experience where it will rise up from my lower belly/perineum area and gently force my head back; I'll also go into at least a shallow trance where I may or may not have some insights.  I've become fairly adept at entering these states at will, and it will happen almost without fail during meditation and sometimes in yoga class.\n\nIt's been weird."

Yoga classes vary tremendously in length and intensity, so while some classes are vigorous enough to help with weight loss, others are not, though they may offer an array of other benefits.\n\nIf you're interested specifically in weight loss, I recommend looking into vinyasa classes. These classes typically repeat somewhat vigorous sequences and move practitioners on and off the floor, which is a full body movement.\n\nMost yoga classes do not raise the heart rate high enough to offer much cardiovascular work (yes, there are exceptions, but most do not). It would be a good idea to, with the guidance of your doctor, develop a separate cardio routine to complement your yoga practice."

  {
    "body": "I'm late to the party, but wanted to throw my two cents in.\n\nI primarily do hot yoga and it is just *so* awesome! Here are my necessities:\n\n* Yoga towel (some ppl use a regular towel) over your yoga mat. This is essential, otherwise you will slip and slide all over your mat.\n\n* My studio offers a basket of hand-towels to use. This super helpful! I keep a hand towel at the head of my mat so that I can grab it while in forward fold to quickly wipe my face/arms when needed.\n\n* I'm always surprised people don't mention a head-band for hot yoga. I have to wear a headband on my forehead to 1) keep hair back and, more importantly, 2) to keep sweat out of my eyes! Bonus points if it is a wide headband so you can cover your ears if needed. I will pull my headband over my ears at the end of class during floor work (i.e., bridge, savasana, etc) to keep sweat out of my ears!\n\n* I don't know if you are male or female, but I personally recommend long yoga pants opposed to shorts. I find I need the friction of the pants to hold any arm balances; otherwise my legs slip off my triceps with shorts on.\n\nKeep in mind, your first time in a hot yoga class can feel overwhelming with the heat. Take it easy and rest in savasana if you feel the need. It might take several classes for you to get used to working out in a heated room. Also, I don't recommend eating before class. I intentionally attend hot yoga classes on an empty stomach, otherwise I might get nausea or experience heartburn. With that in mind, I also do not attempt to hydrate *during* a hot yoga class. Hydrate before or after class! \n\nAnother tip: be careful about over-stretching in a hot yoga class. Typically, you can go deeper into poses in a hot yoga class, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea. Listen to your body. Injuries can happen if you overdo it in stretching poses! (speaking from experience, unfortunately!)\n\nAs an aside- I also sweat profusely. Even my forearms will be dripping sweat during class and I will look around and see that no one else's forearms are sweaty. haha! It's cool though. Embrace the heat, embrace the sweat, and you will learn to LOVE it!"

The other practitioners around you are focused on their own practice, so don't feel self-conscious about that either.\n\nIf you somehow have the misfortune of visiting a studio that isn't giving you positive, healthy vibes, find one that does.  Lord knows there are plenty around.\n\nOne final note on mirrors.  Mirrors in studios are really important for helping us modify and improve our positioning and alignment.  An instructor might say something (e.g., \"make sure your shoulders are back and you're standing with a straight back\").  You may think that you're doing that, but years of bad posture (me) have left you unaware of how you actually stand.  I realize that the association we have with mirrors is largely based around vanity, but the mirrors in yoga studios are primarily about function.  Use them with that mindset to work on and improving your practice. \n\nGood luck.  You'll love it."

I am a highly anxious, frequently stressed out person. When I am taking a yoga class, the last thing I want to think about is my to-do list, or my job, or everything that needs to get done at home, etc...\n\nFor me, this means that all of my focus is on each pose and nothing else. Fast-pace classes are great for me opposed to classes where there are a lot of static poses, because I don't like time to think and let all of those stress-filled thoughts enter my head again. At the same time, I like the opportunity to explore my full-range of motion so I personally love it when instructors cue 2-3 rounds of a pose (e.g., 2 rounds of bridge before going into wheel). \n\nWhile I enjoy fast paced classes, that also doesn't mean I want to hurry through a pose with bad form. I appreciate instructors who cue flows, while also respecting that I might take my time to go through each pose. I suppose a good example of this would be flowing through plank --&gt; chataranga--&gt; up-dog --&gt; down-dog. I like it when instructors tell me to \"go through your flow\" and then \"meet in down-dog\" so that I can flow through my chataranga in my own time and pause longer in down-dog.\n\nI really enjoy classes with instructors who guide their students through modifications and offer corrections (either verbal or hands-on) as those verbal reminders are really important for safety (I always forget to engage my core)! Aside from that, I'm not picky about music during the class, but I especially enjoy nature sounds (i.e., waves crashing, birds singing) for savasana.\n\nInstructors who are open to questions and discussion after class are worth their weight in gold. I also appreciate instructors who might pause class before a sequence to remind students proper form and demonstrate that proper form."

It was soothing to have that warm and soft towel draped over you, and his adjustments were always so strong and firm.

I've worked in the medical field and pharmaceutical industry for several years and - simply put - was very disappointed with the recommended treatments, lack of forethought for long term care and hated that an expensive pill was prescribed for every minor ache, pain or symptom when the answer was clearly the need for a lifestyle change. Once disillusioned with the medical field, I dipped back into the therapy field but also felt that it did not take a well-rounded approach to wellness. \n\nI have a strong background in the fitness industry (trainer, collaborating at a start-up gym to get it off the ground, strong knowledge of anatomy/physiology etc.) I have been casually practicing yoga for about 5 years and have taken it more seriously the last year. Looking for a change in career, I finally feel that yoga is the combination I am looking for. \n\nI have 2 wonderful partners/advisors (who will not be taking paychecks). One works in accounting/high finance and the other is a successful entrepreneur, both with the extensive business experience and marketing/tech background that I lack. \n\nCurrently doing a lot of market research and visiting all the studios in my city! I have a marketing firm that I will be utilizing for the majority of my marketing/advertising and website design in the beginning. \n\nI only mentioned teaching the beginner classes myself because my anatomy/physiology background has really made me focus on proper positioning and alignment of limbs, joints, etc. I feel that I can help beginners to really get the basics down and build a strong foundation, but am not sure that I have all the flexibly and techniques of an experienced teacher down yet to feel competent enough to teach more advanced classes."

So, while yoga is a great option for you, it's not necessarily any better than biking or running or going to the gym.

Most people don't understand it at all.  They think its a kind of intense concentration. They aren't exactly wrong, but it's more like a mental non-resistance. If you're interested in mindfulness, consider going to a zen temple and learning from someone who can give you the proper guidance."

    "body": "A couple of things came to my mind as I was reading your post, as I was in a terrible shape when I started doing yoga.  \n\n1) I have been doing yoga since 2014 at least once a week, and my heels still do not touch the floor in down dog.  \n\n2) Maybe try putting your knees further apart in child's pose?  \n\n3) Warm up properly by doing sun salutations or even jogging in place.  \n\n4) As you get stronger your wrists will stop hurting. My wrists would get fatigued and start hurting very fast in the beginning, now they don't hurt at all. However! That was a dull pain, not sharp, and it took a little while for it to start, if you pain is immediate and/or sharp, you might want to try making fists with your hands instead of putting your palms against the floor.  \n\nIf you hurt too much to continue, you need to scale down and modify until you find what you can do without hurting. How you should do a pose in the beginning can be very far away from what the \"final\" pose is. For example, my yoga teachers often advice that if your lower back rounds when you try to do a seated forward fold, you should first put your hands behind you and push yourself upright and focus on that, just sitting upright, before even attempting to fold.  \n\nAll in all, you need to be careful on what kinds of videos you follow - if it does not tell you how to modify for a lesser stretch, find another one. I second what other people have told you that you should try a class to get better guidance in person when you can. In the meanwhile, remember that yoga is not supposed to hurt and in the beginning you will need to modify.  \n\nThis seems like a good, very mild beginner yoga video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7AYKMP6rOE"

As far as deciding whether to attempt a difficult pose or to realize it would be better to do something easier, use your judgment. Are you the kind of person who constantly masochisticly pushes yourself when up against a challenging task? Then you should probably back off. If you're the type who is usually good at finding mental balance and calm in difficult tasks, or else tends to not have enough confidence, then you should try pushing yourself."

I made significant improvements in weight, muscle, and flexibility. I had incredibly tight hamstrings and horrible upper body strength. I felt almost like I was plateauing. I wanted more strength and flexibility. I randomly started weight training this last May. I have so far gotten a pretty good balance between both yoga and lifting weights every week, and holy shit, I’ve seen incredibly changes now. My upper body strength is so much better, as are my tight hamstrings. Endurance has gotten easier. \n\nAnyway, yes, it’s good for losing weight and toning. It does the trick and is so rewarding. I absolutely love yoga. Even 10 minutes a day is excellent. . But it is a long process that requires patience.

I just completed YTT with CorePower and from my experience, the requirements to receive the certification was pretty standard. 4 1 page double spaced personal essays, a few required to be present classes (anatomy), and the remaining all in alignment with Yoga Alliance RYT 200. They do offer an extensions program which counts for an additional 50 hrs to your certification, however it is not required to audition for a position to teach at the studio. I don’t plan to teach there, have not taken extension, and will most likely not participate in any auditions, and my experience was wonderful. Maybe mine was unique but I felt like you got what you put into it and no pressure at all. \n\nA good friend of mine took her YTT from a reputable but smaller studio locally during the same window and found her experience dropped in quality dramatically after the first couple of weeks. They didn’t learn a general sequence to take with them, very unstructured learning environment and exam guidelines. \n\nI think there’s pros and cons to both. It’s up to the person who’s paying and investing in YTT to ultimately decide where the best fit and direction is, and to ask questions. I personally called over 7 studios and asked about their programs before committing. Schedule, timeline, costs, quality, all things to take into account. \n\nI had never heard of the pyramid scheme mentality at CorePower and haven’t experienced it over the last year, but that’s super unfortunate for those who have. YTT can be incredibly vulnerable and emotional, it would feel especially difficult to invest in something like the 200 hr cert just to feel taken advantage of or like another cog in the wheel"

So it's not only affordable, but it's really intimate and friendly in a casual way, and most people are regulars.\n\nPersonally I've found it extremely worth the money! The one session I go to weekly has pushed me to improve in strength and skill FAR more than I was able to alone, and having someone to spot and guide me through inversions, arm balances and even good old down dog to make sure I'm getting the alignment right helps me practice better when I'm on my own as well."

Back off a bit until you can breathe. Keep your breath flowing throughout the practice, and pay particular attention to your breath as you transition from pose to pose. \n\nSecond, hydrate! A decent amount of water before class, and LOTS after. \n\nThird, move slowly. This might not always be possible with the type of class you're doing, but you also may want to consider the type of yoga classes you do vs. the type that works for you best. For instance, a class with a slower moving pace might work better so you're not rushing from Downward Dog to Warrior I in one breath just to go back down to chaturanga to do the whole thing over again on the other side. Hot yoga may also exacerbate the problem. Don't be afraid to go at your own pace, and talk to your teacher before or after class to let them know about your concerns."

    "body": "Agreed. I constantly choose child when the instructor tells us down down or to go thru a flow. Listening to your body and needs is key. No need to play it off as anything. I also have some physical limitations that require modifications. For example, when doing locust, I usually just do a cobra or lift one or two legs with my belly down because of my spine limitation. Sometimes I'm in forward fold and the rest of the class is in plank. I do about 85% of the instructed parts of class and wing it for the remainder just depending on what my body is telling me. I also have my eyes closed in class pretty often, so this helps me to not worry about what those around me are doing. I listen to cues and follow or not follow as I see fit. If you are self conscious that the instructor will judge you or feel ignorned, have a quick word with them before class and ask if they would mind if you did your own things as you saw fit due to tiredness/body limitations etc. Chances are they will encourage this, as it is _your_ practice."

Either way, it's a good idea to bring a small hand towel to class, water, and if you have long hair, a hair tie.\n\nDon't worry about people watching you. Generally, the newbies watch the others because they're trying to learn but once people know what the poses are, they are too busy focusing on themselves to watch anyone else. \n\nYou can take a break anytime you want and even people who have been doing yoga for months still take breaks when they need to (I do). I would check with the instructor to see what they recommend but in the classes I've taken, child's pose, sitting, or laying on your back (shavasana) are acceptable ways to take a break."

You have **negative energy**.\" To which I remarked surprise because I had honestly been enjoying the class. She said I can take other classes with people there, to which point I gave her a raised eyebrow expression like, \"wtf is your problem?\", and said, \"Sureeeeee.\", because goodness, I did not want to be there at that moment. Like the whole exchange was maybe 30 seconds MAX before I hit the change room to get the frick outta there.\n\nI am sort of punching myself here for not asking, \"How am I projecting negative energy?\", so now I am assuming, \"Oh was it because I took time to self-reflect on the poses? Or maybe it was because I took one too many breaks. Or maybe it was because I didn't want to stick the plastic rubber ball under my hip because it hurt me.\" I am guessing that of anything I COULD have done it would most likely be the first thing, as mentioned at the top of the thread, because of anything I could have done, I'm GUESSING that might be it? But holy wow, in the six months of doing yoga I've had like 4 teachers so far including her, I was worried if I was breaking some kind of social code or something :c\n\n...but THEN AGAIN I was genuinely taken aback by how confrontational she sounded. I never engage with anyone who strikes me as fundamentally crazy. Maybe she had her reasons, I did not want to sound argumentative there, another reason being she is the owner of the place, I have several friends who work there, I didn't want to reflect poorly on them.\n\nLike I will probably try be the bigger person, make a show of apologizing if I offended them in any way next week when/if I see them next, ask what they meant about this in a safer setting when we've both chilled out a bit. Because fuck, she just seemed kind of cranky that day, too, in a couple other small ways I sort of see now that I've had a night's sleep to think about it, but hey maybe it was just a bad day for her."

So he quickly changed his teaching for the day. He spent the entire class, half a day, explaining how to sit properly. He could have done it in one sentence. But not much point in going further if they didn't have the capacity for more. They probably still aren't sitting up straight now. The patience of that teacher must have been incredible.\n\nSitting properly is important so a person can breath properly.

    "body": "Ashtanga and Kundalini are both GREAT options for your situation, but meet different requirements/preferences listed in the original post. \n\nAshtanga is very easy to learn without a physical teacher in front of you because the Asana sets are mostly predetermined. Patanjali (the Yogi who taught Ashtanga originally) laid out very specific and structured rules for the practice of Ashtanga. For example, a Yogi is supposed to perform astang practices to the rhythm of one's breathing and music should not be played. This is a very structured and disciplined practice that would work well to help health, discipline, and breath.\n\nKundalini is, in my experience, the yin to the ashtanga yang. Kundalini is performing repetitive movements or specific actions for a set amount of time. For example, a common and very beneficial kriya is called cat/cow. One alternates between arching the back (cat) and dropping the belly (cow) while on one's hands and knees, Going as quickly and rhythmically as one's body allows for three minutes. This type of yoga is very good for mental strength and maintaining all body systems. Yogi Bhajan, the Yogi that brought Kundalini Yoga to the US, has hundreds of classes and lectures for free online. \n\nI have a bias towards Kundalini over Ashtanga because of the wonderful effects my Kundalini practice had on my life. When I started practicing Kundalini, it improved every area of my life; my physical health, my digestion, my happiness, my perspective on other people, my empathy and compassion, my overall outlook on life. I have been practicing for 3 years now and I cannot imagine not practicing. Please let me know if you have any questions or want more in-depth info. I hope you find a practice that helps you grow and that you cherish."

    "body": "Ok so the most vivid experiences that I have had usually start with the crazy tingling in the crown chakra as well as that floating feeling. I had the opportunity to float in a sensory deprivation tank, and I use memories of that feeling to bring me back to the calm of weightlessness. Once I’m really getting into clear minded-ness, I either fixated on the imagery of a doorway that I need to step into or the concept of the purest white/blue until it engulfs me. The first time I had a truly realistic experience I was in a garden with a woman who was made of light, and we had a very real conversation in which we were talking with one another but it was more in a telekinesis sort of way than with tangible voices. However, I asked her questions, like who are you? And she told me that she has always been watching me. I asked, where are we? She told me that we were in the most beautiful garden and that I’m welcome to come back at any time. I asked her how to get here, she told me “you’ve always been here.” (That one really stuck with me!) and she told me that I don’t have to worry about anything because she knows that I’ll come back. That was really strange and disorienting when I came to, and I didn’t really know what the hell to think about it. I was like ?? Was that god? Was that a dream? Was that real? And I just sought after philosophy texts and I listened a lot to Alan Watts (if you haven’t listened to his lectures, please do! I recommend him to everyone!) and eventually i had another meditation experience in which was vividly like a dream, and I was sitting around a campfire with what seemed to be Native Americans or some sort of peoples who live off the land, and I had the feeling, though no one told me, that we were all family. And this one is really interesting, because I overheard some of the “ancestors” talking and it was like they were pointing at me or whispering where I couldn’t hear them, and they said “this soul has a child’s heart. She carries that gift forever.” That really got me for a long time and still does because I think that that is the truest statement that anyone has said of me, but the problem is, I didn’t come up with it. Although all of this happened in my head, in a wildly vivid way, it felt like I was sitting and watching a movie that someone else wrote.That’s where I got my theory about meditation being similar to dreams. If you think about it, when you’re having a crazy dream, you are both the writer, the director, and the actors, but you are also watching from the audience, watching and participating from the first time as if you didn’t actually write the whole thing! It’s a really strange dual-role. Characters in dreams can fill you in on the plot and what’s happening around you, and you can listen as if you’ve never heard it before and it’s new information, which totally doesn’t make sense because you’re the other characters too. That’s what my meditations felt like, but in a much more real feeling and they always had a different tone and a different feeling attached, so I know I wasn’t really sleeping, obviously. I don’t think that I really have ancestors or god beings that just sit around waiting to tell me about my soul until I happen to meditate again, though it does feel like that. Rather, I think they are a part of my subconscious that can only be accessed when I’m in that perfect heart-coherence and my brain is on that specific wavelength.

How has the interpretation of a yoga practice been reduced to postures?

After the first pose, I know exactly where I stand and how hard I should push myself for the next 90 mins. As someone who is an on and off practitioner, Bikram yoga allows me to gauge and track my progress. I love the poses because they’re isometric and give me enough time to fine tune them. Yes, the instructors play a huge part in my experience and I take their pseudoscience with a grain of salt (some studios stay far away from the pseudoscience and have a differing opinion on how to straighten the knee). It has been tremendously therapeutic for my knee/ankle sprains and regaining flexibility after sedentary periods.\n\nOh and you should take a couple of months to ease into it or you could hurt yourself."

As a yoga practitioner for many years and a qualified yoga instructor (not currently teaching), I'm familiar with the landscape. Newly qualified teachers should be given a chance, but might have to accept doing a few classes for free or at a reduced rate, until they find their feet and gain confidence (teaching yoga well is not easy!).

I had a driving teacher start getting weird on me and when I asked him to stop via text (because I was scared to do it in person lol), he ignored it, despite responding to every other text I'd sent him about lesson times previously. He really should've apologised or at least said \"Sure, no problem, I'll stop doing those specific things.\" But because I had no idea what his reaction to my message was, I never felt comfortable seeing him again.

The best way to keep at it is doing yoga with a teacher and a group, with which you also social interact and talk to (imo of course).\n\nAnother way to keep Yoga (or any activity really) fresh is to read about it, watch videos, set goals, talk to other people about it etc. Basically it is necessary to put something in if you want something back. And just doing Yoga like a robot every day isn't enough (not saying that that is what you are doing :)\n\nAs far as the mental aspect is concerned: Although there certainly is a distinctive \"magic\" to Yoga when one does it right (proper breath, playing the edge etc.) just doing Asana for a few weeks might not be enough to be \"life changing\" (again imo).\n\nLike I said I don't know about your specific situation and whether some sort of therapy might be a better avenue. As far as \"spiritual practice\" is concerned I personally find it mandatory to also do meditation. \n\nJust having a quite vague, general intention like \"positive attitude\" probably won't work.

Everyone’s body is different and everyone brings a different energy into class. I’m pretty fit but sometimes I’ll take rest more often because I had a hard workout the day before, or I just woke up tired. I also lack some upper body strength/shoulder stability so arm balancing in particular is something I’ll skip from time to time. Some people’s body structure will actually make certain poses more difficult, so my instructor will even say that if forward fold doesn’t work for you, you don’t have to do it.\n\nHonestly, if an instructor DOESN’T have this kind of attitude, I would not want to be taking class with them.

This was helpful in warrior asanas, as well. Anything to achieve proper alignment (within the constraints of the individual body) is so beneficial. \n\nI had an instructor help me perfect my chair pose once by gently shaping my form once I was in the position. It was difficult for me to understand how to tuck the tailbone without a bit of guidance. \n\nMy FAVORITE was the instructor who would pick my ankles up while beginning shavasana and swing them back and forth, providing a gentle lower back release."

I try to buy all of my electronics second hand, etc.  I'm all about that!\n\nAlthough, I've decided I need to buy a new mat for three big reasons.  The first is that I don't know anyone who does/did yoga to use their second-hand mat.  Second, I need something that I can wash easily.  Being a tall person, I haven't seen a rug that fits my height AND is machine washable/is washable in general (since I will be taking the mat to places).  Finally, I realized I just need a rubber mat.  I've been using a very large rug as an impromptu yoga mat, which has been fine for yoga, but I do a bit of physical therapy stretches and what not due to a damaged knee and my back.  Having something with better grip would make those much easier.\n\nThe TL;DR is that I want you to know that I'm not trying to blow off you comment, and that I actually agree with your sentiment.

I spent about half the time looking around and going \"wtf\" and the other half wishing I hadn't worn sweatpants and eye makeup.\n\nThe cool thing is that it's the same poses in the same order every time, so once you have a few classes under your belt, you know what to expect AND the heat gets much easier. It's normal to get light headed! You can sit down and drink water whenever you please. \n\nThis sub, for whatever reason, loves to bash bikram yoga.\n\nAs far as it not being \"real\" yoga (whatever that means) Bikram yoga was developed by Bikram and Bishnu Ghosh, brother of Paramahansa Yogananda in Calcutta India and then later brought to the west. It is still taught today at Ghosh's Yoga College of India. \n\nBikram yoga falls under the umbrella of hatha yoga, which means you're breathing while holding a pose with a short rest in between poses. The poses are not linked together as you might find in a flow class. Neither hatha or flow (vinyasa) are \"natural\" or \"unnatural\" they're just different styles of yoga asana.\n\nThe locked out knee! Straightening your standing leg(s) by contracting your muscles in a way that helps your joints get stronger. That means weight even on the standing foot, thigh muscle contracted, butt muscle and hamstring both contracted. Is it hard to do? yes. Is it worth the effort? also yes. What if I can't do it yet? Just do your best! It will get there.\n\nBikram yoga is just as safe as any other form of exercise. The teacher in my very first class? was 8 months pregnant at the time and practiced until the day she gave birth!\n\nAs a teacher of the bikram method (now known as Original Hot Yoga, 26&amp;2, Hot 90 etc) I hope I can help clear some things up. \n\nThere were a very small group of people close to Bikram who were complicit in his poor behavior and that is their karma to deal with. Additionally, he is NOT the first \"guru\" to harass and assault women, (looking at you, Pattabhi Jois and John Fruend) and sadly, he probably wont be the last.\n\nI am part of the first generation of teachers to NOT be trained by Bikram himself. Bikram studios are independently owned, small businesses....not franchises. Most are changing their names anyway.\n\nAfter the horrendous conduct of one man, and those who enabled him, we saw the near-collapse of our community. It has been a painful and tough process to cut the cancer away and begin to heal, but we have done it and we are moving on.\n\nThe 26&amp;2 series is tremendously therapeutic and has saved my life. This is the case for countless others all over the world as well. You of course don't have to practice it if you don't want to, I hope this info is helpful :)"

My husband started doing yoga with me during a difficult time in our relationship, and it helped, but for the reasons you suggested and not specifically because it was yoga. Regular exercise improved both our mental states, having a new shared activity helped us interact more positively with each other, and the mindfulness/introspection aspect of yoga helped us work on ourselves as individuals.

    "body": "It could be your forward folds. Those can be really problematic. Try bending your knees generously through all the forward folds of a couple of classes and see if that takes the heat off your back. If so then that’s it.\n\nBending knees (even slightly) in the forward fold unlocks the backs of your legs and hips and allows you to lean forward more easily from your hip rather than your lower back. This should take the strain off.\n\nThen there’s the other main culprit - up dog. A proper up dog has hands and toes (and no other part of the body) touching the floor. And it is an UPPER back opener. The lower back is involved but only in a supporting role. If your lower back is the star of that show then you are going to have problems.\n\nAs you enter up dog it’s helpful, as you push up with your arms, to think about moving your heart horizontally through the gate you’ve created with your arms, and to think about keeping the lower back straight. This will put the opening in the right place. But note, your heart may not move past your arms, and your lower back may not be straight - that’s ok, you’re trying to create the feeling of heading towards those things, not actually doing them. You can also imagine as if someone put their fist in the middle of your upper back and you are opening up around it. That can also create the right sensation.\n\nWheel, bridge, wild thing, sure - they could also cause problems but if you think about it, these things ask flexibility of your back, but don’t require it to carry much weight (which goes into your hands and feet). They don’t feel like the right suspects here.\n\nThose are my thoughts for you..."

When I quit drinking for the last time, a little over three years ago, I deliberately changed my perspective on life, my body, my mind, what I wanted, everything. I made the move I'd known for a long time and went full on vegan, helped in no small part from stumbling into the aforementioned subreddit. Plant based diet, Dr. Greger as the prophet of a new generation, these are my people now.\n\nInstead of coming home after a long, stressful day at work and plowing through a 12, 18, or 30 rack, I had something else to do - cook! Make delicious, healthy, filling meals that helped repair my body and my psyche. Eating plant based, no sodium, no oils, just plants and more plants, helped bring me back to center, probably for the first time in my adult life. It's become such a big part of my life now, I got off work and am making salsa right now! I needed something to look forward to, something I knew would make me happy, a light at the end of the tunnel. Instead of intoxication and stupefaction as my desired goal, I swapped to omg this is going to be so fucking delicious, let's see what we can do, try things, experiment, fucking love it.\n\nI'm making a nice big batch of salsa right now at 10:30 at night and am genuinely excited for the results! If you're not down for going full plant based, why not try your hand at some salsa over on /r/SalsaSnobs - guac and salsa and pico and all the fun things with none of the hangover!\n\nI feel you. Give it a shot. Doesn't work, no big deal, now you know it doesn't work! But you have to change your perspective just as much as your actions. The universe is all mental, and you help shape what you get out of it.\n\nEdit: Did some more reading, just throwing it out there - you wanna lose some weight? /r/PlantBasedDiet will get you there no problem. Portion control becomes much less of an issue when you're eating foods with significantly less caloric density. I'm fucking *lithe*. If I don't deliberately eat more than I'm comfortable with sometimes I drop like a stone to below 130. 18.1 BMI is the sweet spot. Does that sound like a tasty goal to you?"

I suppose by releasing the fascia, that leads to more of a relaxed state that may in turn helps the nervous system. You’ll feel more relaxed.\n\nTypically what helps the nervous system, more specifically the parasympathetic system is pranayama. Perhaps, they are teaching a specific pranayama technique in those classes which helps. Generally exhaling longer than inhaling sends a message to the parasympathetic system and can ease anxiety."

    "body": "Yoga instructor here! Yoga is about connecting with the body, mind, and spirit. While practicing yoga, it’s best to focus on your breath. Practicing ujjayi helps because you can 1) use your diaphragm and 2) hear your breath, therefore you can alter it to your liking - 4 seconds in and 4 seconds out is recommended for beginners.\n\nBe aware on how the poses make your body feel. This is your time to practice mindfulness and allow all of your senses to be fully observed. \n\nA yoga sequence should start with a meditation/centering practice and end in savasana. This is important for your practice! In the beginning of your practice, set your intention. If you wish to, imagine a cleansing light encompassing your body. In savasana, it is your time to relax and take in the lovely feeling yoga brings to you. Savasana is the key to that relaxed, “buzzed” feeling you get after yoga.\n\nAnother thing that helps is reading into the philosophy. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali is a great book about the journey of yoga. I totally recommend it! :)"

Ive gotten more personal attention at lpac and their sister gyms, their teachers were pretty legit, many gave good instructions and modifications and they worked with me, so dont count the fitness clubs out, they may have good teachers too.\n\nRe: wrist pain, Ive seen our instructor have people with wrist pain do the dolphin instead of a downward dog.

Also try to walk into yum r toes as close as you can before kicking up. This will help you to keep and maintain core engagement going into it. \n\nI would look up some prep for handstand press ups - that motion in the core and hips sort of reflects the type of core engagement needed for most handstands and inversions.\n\nOtherwise looks amazing!

I worked more on right side since it was less frustrating. Recently I found out that my left ankle is actually MORE flexible than my right one, that I found odd, I assumed my lower left side was \"worst\" in every aspect.\n\nAn area where I see big differences is on arm balancing transactions, for istance I can quite easly lift up and transition from upavista konasana to eka pada kundiasana if I turn to the right leg, but if I turn to the left I'm not even half way there, I just can't find the movement."

Does anyone else deal with that...?\n\n&gt;Are there any other thoughts on what you wish you had known prior to studio practice?\n\nA good instructor will give modifications for every level. Please listen to your body. If you feel discomfort, come out of the pose. It’s not “giving up.”\n\nAs for anxiety, please be kind to yourself. No one will be paying much attention to you, much less judging you. Don’t compare yourself to anyone else in the room. I like to compare myself to the last time I came to the mat, and notice any similarities or differences. (That’s what I mean about no one paying much attention to you. They’ve all turned their focus inward.)\n\nThe biggest (and to me best) difference about a yoga class vs. home practice is that you’ll have someone to teach you proper alignment and offer correction. Please be open and accept it for what it is—an opportunity to improve your practice and prevent injury.\n\nA good instructor will ask permission before touching you, and it’s perfectly ok to say no. \n\nEvery room is different.

    "body": "Hey there, yeah, you're definitely overthinking this. As a yoga teacher and someone who got into yoga to deal with back and hip pain, this early in your practice you should really focus on body alignment. It's important to know where your limbs and joints should be in each pose and I'm not sure how much of that your teacher will cover in an all-levels class. So try the beginner-friendly ones first and maybe talk to the instructor to ask for guidance. \nWhatever class you try, take it slow and be really mindful of what your body is telling you when you're in a pose. Your body doesn't lie. If a pose is painful, get out of it. There's no shame in taking child's pose or even going back to a pose that you know serves you. \nFinally, don't worry if you're not super confident from the get-go. Everyone in class is there to learn and practice. It is called a yoga practice because it's never perfect. I hope this helps ��"

Downdog is a fantastic app and I highly recommend purchasing it as it is only I think $40/year (or you can wait for a half off promo) which is an absolute steal considering most classes are at least $10 a piece when you buy a package at a studio. There are free classes on Youtube but if you want variety I would go with DD or an RYT 500's website catalog (especially Jenni Rawlings - her class catalogue is plentiful with many teachers and only $8.99/month and you can join and quit any time). TBH people teaching proper asana practice spend a lot of time and money doing so and are just trying to make a living (including DD especially because they have app developers involved) so think about what you do and your worth and how you'd feel if someone wanted you to do it for free.

He would use towels to create a literal physical barrier between himself and students when doing hands on adjustments. It honestly felt amazing, and it was really comforting to know he put this much thought and care into protecting his students and allowing them to feel safe in their bodies.\n\nYour teacher has crossed a line.

    "body": "Ok. So. I hear this argument a lot, and we have discussed it at my Iyengar studio several times, and there's also some good articles on the web about it. This is what I know: if your pelvis is supported in a backbend (think locust or bow) you don't benefit much from gluteal engagement, because the pelvis rests on the floor, and that engagement hinders the spinal flexion, which, in supine back bends, is not something you want to hinder, and it won't harm you/there is no risk of over extending the hip flexors because there is a physical barrier pressing against the pelvis. The biggest no-nos here are going to be a lack of proper core and lower back engagement (something we can see a lot of in bow, for instance. Kicking your feet harder into your hands to make up for a lack of upper back engagement/core strength is a ticket to injury- but that is another topic entirely). \n\nHowever, in backbends like camel, you do want to engage the glutes, because this helps push the hips forward, protects the SI joint, and protects less efficient muscle groups from being strained with effort. And, interestingly enough, if you are super flexible or hypermobile, engaging the glutes becomes even more important! \n\nThe only thing you have to watch for is too much splaying of the knees when you do engage your glutes. \n\nI hope this helps! There is a wealth of information on this subject!"

Maybe run through the standing sequence and see how that feels for you. \n\nThose are all great things to focus on, but crazy making if you try to focus on them all at once. Try focusing on the breath one day, the pelvic floor another day, alignment another day, and stretching on the 4th day. If you keep the same sequence each day then it is easy to play around with the focus.\n\nAlso, those seated poses are good, however they keep your hips on the ground and limit your range of motion, while placing excess stress on the lumbar/sacrum connection, vs the standing poses where the hips can pivot around the femur reducing stress on the spine."

This really just relates back to retaining money in the business, rather than having more payroll costs. \n\nLastly,  you should certainly consider completing a yoga teacher training before endeavoring to open a studio because it can end up being so much MORE than just learning to teach. I benefitted in more ways I could have imagined from YTT. The real connection between my practice and weaving yoga throughout my life was developed during this time. This is what helps build a community, not just attendees. \n\nWhatever you do, best of luck ❤️\n\n(Edit for clarity)"

Then you can just change the way you do your yoga poses a little.\n\nThe most effective stretching methods generally follow this: General warm up. Find a comfortable gentle amount of stretch then stay there for at least 30 seconds to 1 minute, let the nervous system calm down. Start some kind of active or strong use of the targeted muscle, like PNF, that produces gains. After that find a reasonable challenge in the static stretch and stay there for at least 1 minute, 5 minutes is better. The last part is really important so the gains aren't quickly lost.

The digital age has heightened this, and we're suffering for it. Attention spans are down, anxiety is up! \n\nThere will be yoga practises that will no doubt help, if done regularly and with a bit of guidance. It's probably not going to happen overnight, but hopefully you'll start to notice an improvement with time. But also look at other lifestyle factors - use of stimulants, how many hours sleep your getting a night, diet / sugar consumption, how much media you're consuming on a daily basis etc. Out of all of these sleep is probably the most important - aim for 8 hours a night (for more information on this / scientific backing, I recommend the book \"why we sleep\" by Mathew Walker.\n\nGood luck, and best wishes!

PNF stretching, hamstring strengthening, and consistency (I practiced 2-3x a week) are key. It’s completely doable, it just requires more time and dedication than when you were a teenager, and you’re likelier to injure yourself. But... totally doable!\n\nI will add that most of my splits progress has been through my sport—pole dance/aerials—rather than yoga alone.

  {
    "body": "Lots of good advice here, but I'm going to be a bit contrary to some of it. Try NOT to look around while you're practicing. I know that a brief glance for the basic shape of the pose can be necessary if the instructor isn't cueing step by step and bus stopping, but use the time to connect with yourself- learn to feel where your body is in space and how to move it. Outside of optimising for safety and to target muscle groups, the final shape of your pose matters far less than the effort and energy you put into it, so don't worry so much about how you look, concentrate on how you feel.   \n\n\nYoga can be physically challenging even for people who are in great shape as a lot of the movement and effort is outside of what our normal patterns demand of us, but you seem to be ready for this. Take breaks when needed. As an instructor, this is useful information to me when I see my students begin to come down to rest, it is expected that you will rest as needed. As others have mentioned, child's pose is the traditionally offered resting pose for when you need a break, but it is a pose that doesn't always work for every body (when you google it, google modifications if it isn't a comfortable pose for you), and for the first couple of classes you might be best served by sitting in vajrasana or virasana on a block or two and observing.   \n\n\nWhen you talk to your instructor before class, ask them about their policy on questions during class- some places it is strictly verboten, but some teachers love the chance to clarify things and give impromptu mini-workshops. If the teacher is OK with it, remember that if something is very confusing, there's a good chance that someone else has the same question. Also, your instructors are human too- sometimes we forget things or get confused. Most of us appreciate our attention being drawn to something we left out on one side or that we are cueing the same side you just finished working, just, be gentle :)\n\n \n\nDepending on where you practice, you might need to bring your own props (blocks/belt/blanket), especially if you are going to a gym or a rec center or an outdoor class. Most studios will have these things available, but you might want to call ahead first, and even if you have nothing else to bring, a towel or a small fleece blanket to sit on at the beginning of class and/or to pad your knees in kneeling poses can be very useful (I keep a fleece blanket rolled up in my mat all the time now).  \n\n\nAbove all else, remember that it is your practice, not your neighbor's or your instructor's. Remember always that you have agency to say no to anything that you don't like- poses that don't work for where your body is at the moment, anything that creates pain, hands on adjustments if you aren't comfortable with them- any thing."

In fact, you don't even have to have your feet off the ground at first. Let the weight sink into your feet on the ground while hanging from bar. Feel how your relaxed breath almost lifts you slightly. You can do leg/knee raises into passive hang. You can rock, wave, bend, whatever you want to do... Just play and explore and make the bar another home. Focus on mindful breathing while you do the movements and holds. You will master the bar over time as you develop an intimate relationship with the bar."

(You may even also add a block or blanket under the hips and on top of the bolster for even more support.)  \n\\-Also allow the straightened leg to rest so that you can open up the hips and focus on the positioning of that front leg.   \n\\-As you gain flexibility and strength - lose the bolster and carry on.\n\nThis will give you better support as you focus on getting your front leg in the proper spot. \n\nHope that helps.

    "body": "Speaking from the experience of going too hard, too fast, and too deep in yoga resulting in a lower back injury (herniated discs), please listen to your body and go slow.\n\nHere are tips to reduce the stress on your lower back:\n\n* Lots of rest, don't rush back into yoga!\n\n* Laying on your stomach to reduce the pressure on your lower back and even trying to go into a cobra position can help relieve that stress on your lower back.\n\n* Traction: If you have access to one, hanging from a pull-up bar will help to decompress your spine\n\n* Swimming is another activity that is easy on your back.\n\n* Heat is nice, but I personally found that ice helped more than heat. Lay on your stomach with an ice pack on your back and just relax.\n\nAs someone else mentioned, in the long term you will want to focus on your core. A strong core will help to prevent back injuries. As you return to yoga, focus on good technique in each posture and engage your core. Deep hamstring stretches can be specifically straining to your lower back so ease into your hamstring stretches. If you enjoy power or vinyasa flows, be sure to engage your core through chatarangas. It's okay to skip chataranga flows and go straight into down-dog if your lower back is speaking to you.\n\nIf you continue to have back pain for longer than 1 week, or if you start to experience sciatica (nerve pain down your leg), I recommend going to visit your primary physician. They may recommend an MRI or physical therapy."

Remind the student that they are welcome to enter the class just before it starts, instead of several minutes ahead, if they find it more conducive to their own practice to have some silence before class. They can control their own selves, but it’s not reasonable for them to expect to control others or for you to control the other class members\n\n3. Approach the student with curiosity and ask them why it bothers them so much. Maybe something like “I have heard your concerns before, but I would like to better understand where they are coming from so I can help you more effectively. Why is it that talking before class is so problematic for you?”\n\nIf all else fails, remind them they can do yoga at home if they can’t handle other people being around! ��\n\nAlso, congrats on your classes being such a hit!"

You should always be able to lift the legs up without straining. \n\nThere is huge difference between being really strong generally and a great deal of strength control at end range or throughout the entire range of movement.\n\nYou'll get it!\n\n4minute edit: I have never seen a hollowback headstand (probably not safe) but a hollowback forearmstand could be a big help here, at start of this video Dolphin into Scorpion Pose, Yoga tutorial with MacKenzie Miller ...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KbbBVzxRwE"

As far as what I feel makes a good teacher, it’s mostly about the person who is their most authentic self while teaching and who understands that he or she is not going to be the best teacher for every student. Be kind and compassionate.\n\nEven with just the few responses on here so far you can see that. Don’t micromanage versus give me alignment down to the centimeter of where my pinky toe should be. Play awesome music versus don’t use music. Impart all your yoga philosophy wisdom versus allow my mind time to get into my inner self.\n\nPretty much my only real deal breaker is, for the love of everything “Don’t talk during sivasana!” Set it up, have a seat, and then bring the class out."

She did a 2 hour shoulders and wrist self care workshop and showed us lots of drills we can Do for like 2-4 minutes each to help build strength and stability for poses like Pincha and handstand. I also hired a personal trainer at the beginning of this year and started to rock climb too, and I’ve noticed since I have started to focus on strengthening and stabilizing my shoulders, wrist, and upper back...as well as doing a good amount of “pulling” workouts to compliment all the “pushing” we do in yoga...my inversions have gotten significantly better and things have started to fall into place. \n\nMy favorite drills are:\n\n1. Wrist warm up in table top: so from tabletop shifting forward and back with the fingers facing forward. Then fingers face the sides, rock side to side. Fingers face the knees, palms still down, and gently try to draw the hips toward the heels. And then lastly flipping my palms so the back sides are on the mat, fingers face my knees. \n\n2. Dolphin push ups\n\n3. I bought a wrist dowel/forearm blaster and do that a few times a week. \n\n4. Wrist extension and flexion exercises with a 5-8lb dumbbell. \n\n5. Not sure the official name but you raise you arms up overhead, arms straight. Open the hands like spirit fingers and then close them into a tight fist...do that as fast as you can over and over for 1 minute. Your forearms will be on FIRE! \n\n6. And just a lot of shoulder/lat conditioning and training, over and over and over. �� once I found my lats and started to engage and use them, that was key!"

I have been teaching for many years and struggled for some time with saying \"namaste\" because I was concerned that it conflicted with my personal religeos beliefs or others. I had prayed about it and became friendly with one of my church's missionaries that was visiting from India. I expressed my concerns to him, and he told me that eveyone in India (and that region) says Namaste. He explained that it is no different than \"Shalom\" or \"Aloha\". It is simply a greeting. Western yoga culture has spiritualized it, but it is no more than that. \n\nAt my studio, the students expect to hear Namaste. They repeat it back to the teacher. Now, if I weren't to say it, it would probably confuse them but, during the time that I wasn't saying it, I would wish them a blessed or beautiful day."

You also have to drive there and back and pay for a hotel, and since I was the only guy that went, the cost for me was higher since I didn't split a room with anyone. Even though I had known everyone for a year or more, they acted like it was weird of me to even ask, even though I offered to sleep on the floor. I thought we were all adults? Guess not. Guess I'll pay an extra $40 per night then, THANKS. There were two practices per day, one in the morning and one in the evening, and since you paid for the \"program\", I felt compelled to go to all of them to feel like I got my money's worth. There were also nearby amenities, but they knew it was a place people travel to, so everything was overpriced. You could get an overpriced massage, rent an overpriced kayak ect.\n\nSo basically I spent several hundred dollars and a few hours of driving to go to 2 yoga classes per day and then sat in the hotel room alone the whole rest of the time, only leaving to go eat with the group. So before you decide to go, calculate all the expenses involved, then divide by how many practices there will be, then decide if it's worth the cost per practice. For example, if it's gonna cost a total of $400 for you to go, and there are a total of 6 practices, you need to decide if it's worth $66 per class to do yoga in the woods. I don't think it's worth it and will not be going on any more yoga retreats."

The lulu is thinner, and doesn’t feel as “thick/solid”, but it does do a better job of not getting slippy.   It’s a matter of taste.  Those are my two favorite mats &amp; I go back &amp; forth.  The GRP shows no wear after a year.  The lulu shoes scuffs, but no problematic wear.   The GRP can be hosed/soaked/submerged &amp; the lulu is a little more sensitive about cleaning methods."

I want my studio to be inclusive, and if that means including beginners who need to get used to the practice and the format of classes, we're including them! \n\nI do have one tip for you regarding minimizing talking about the beginning of classes. (Please note - this tip is only if you want it! This is your class, and it's totally up to you to decide if you want less talking at the beginning of class or not.) If you have the lights on a very low setting, it seems to discourage talking. I don't fully know why this is the case, but I see it happen very consistently. Dim room = quiet room."

I think if it was me I would message him once on Instagram, something like, “these private messages are making me uncomfortable. Please stop.” then block him and also send a message to the studio owners. It doesn’t really matter whether his intentions are innocent or not (I suspect he’d say they were if confronted but of course he would).

There was a large community of yogis that called this studio home.  The teachers and the community made the studio such a treasure for the city. However, it appears that the owner was in horrible financial turmoil and is likely solely responsible for the studio's failure.\n\nThe lesson I take away from this is to not take your financial situation lightly. Be mindful about money. Running a yoga studio is in fact both running a business AND facilitating a community for like-minded souls to congregate (as opposite as those ideals seem). This experience has left a very deep impression on my mind and if I ever owned a yoga studio I would keep this dichotomy at the forefront of my mind."

Very regimented, practitioners do it at the crack of dawn, and enough progressions to take you from the most beginner level to more advanced levels than most of us dream of. The blueprints are laid out for you and you are to follow them to a T.\n\nKundalini would also be a good one. Very different from ashtanga but an equally powerful practice in its own way. \n\nReally I think any form would work for you and be beneficial. The best one is the one that you will actually do consistently. \n\nPersonally I prefer moving slowly and I don’t like something quite as regimented, so for me some sort of Slow Vinyasa would be the method of choice. \n\nI think it’d be good for you to dip around for a couple weeks, try different modalities so you can see what really resonates with you. Hard to do in your current circumstances, but YouTube can bring anything your way (As can one of the many streaming services that provide daily classes).\n\nWhichever you choose, be it vinyasa, ashtanga, jivamukti, kundalini etc. just keep showing up. Build it into your daily routine so it becomes a part of your existence. Make it a long term thing."

    "body": "Up until I'll say the 1950s only men were allowed. It sounds really bad to have sexism in yoga for thousands of years but there was actually a very sensible reason for it. In a way. Men or boys were started on their yoga studies at a very young age, 8 years old or teenagers. The old teachers knew if they had girls in there the boys would be distracted from their studies. Girls can do that you know. That was one of the reasons. Women were always treated as lower class as well so I am sure that had something to do with it as well. They could have had separate schools for boys and girls.\n\nAround 1950 a new Shankaracharya was appointed at Kancheepuram (city in India). That's like the head swami for all swamis. There was a thousands year old practice of having women as slaves in the temples and the first thing he did was abolish that and make other changes.\n\nOther places have examples of more progressive thought around this time as well.

When walking, sitting, standing - any times I'm not distracted or engrossed in the matter at hand, I am usually cultivating a mindful disposition or reflecting on what I've read. Formally, I practice seated meditation for 20 mins before bed maybe once or twice a week.\n\nI practice a Chinese Zen style. I will sometimes do a bit of breath work (focusing on the dantien), but normally I sit and contemplate a koan over and over until I feel my head release all its pressure. I finish when I feel the koan can't be penetrated anymore (and, also, it doesn't penetrate me anymore), then I go to sleep. I dream vividly those nights as well.\n\nHere is a link to the style: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hua_Tou"

So perhaps stay away from vinyasa-style classes. The gentler yoga classes might provide a nice transition to exercise and help with the tightness, but you won't lose much weight or build muscle in a yin or beginner yoga class. Power yoga is faster pace and they don't hold the poses as long, so if you are looking for some cardio this might be a good option for you."

It completely solved it for me. You might also look at your shape in up dog, if my feet are too far forward I can get a little extra pressure on low back and wrists in the transition.\n\nEdit to clarify after looking at the other responses, I do *not* go back to chatarunga, just straight up and back from up dog"

Stretching them more only make them weaker and therefore at higher risk of injury (Hamstring injury is one of the most common in Yoga).\n\nA reason why hamstrings are often so weak, is because many of us spend all day sitting at a desk. A sitting position is a hip flexion! So your hamstrings are in a stretched position for hours and hours.\n\nSomething you can add to your yoga practice is squeezing a block between the heel and the glute (one leg at a time) in either table top or Downward facing dog. Squeeze the block and feel the burn - maybe also the cramp (cramps are a sign that the muscle is weak!). You can also lift the knee (towards a hip extension) to work the hamstrings more.\n\nAlways think that the muscles you're stretching also need strengthening to balance things out. \n\nPractice safe and mindfully:)"

It’s like the hamstrings tightening and causing some referred pain in the low back, OR weakness in the glutes/hammies/low back. \n\nWhen your range of motion starts to expand beyond the strength of area muscles to support that ROM, you get pain. That’s your body trying to protect you from injury. Bodies are smart. \n\nAs an electrician, I imagine your job is very physical — I’d be paying as much attention to how you move during the day as your yoga practice. \n\nFocus on strength in glutes &amp; hams (think: squats where you can feel your butt working more than quads), and regular flexibility for the hams. \n\nAlso: never fold forward with straight/locked knees!!! Please please please. \n\nEnjoy your practice!"

What does a mat have to do with yoga?\n\n Yoga, isn't bodily-obsession through postural regimes on a mat... In fact, such beings were traditionally seen as street side jokes in Bharat, not genuine sadhaks. And the western world has taken that expression of hatha to new heights. \n\nYou bypass and regress the grace of this relative misery, by locking up the transcendence of, onto a mat with ball and chain\n\nDid you see Carl Jung on a yoga mat? And yet this man was pure jnani yogi, even if he never uttered those labels himself. \n\nAs you wallow in this relative misery... How long does that emotional phenomenon truly last? Is the observer of this qualia on the side of sorrow, not the same as the one on the side of joy? And yet you attach as though that wave is you.\n\nSilly, all this is simply a dance in the ocean that am.. That stillness is always present. \n\nWhere you sit in misery under the Tiny insignificant spotlight of egos individualism, the sadhak sees the waves of joy and sorrow and brings them under the flood lights of yoga. That relative misery is actually the perfect moment for practice... And you need no mat, you don't even need to leave the couch. It's all here and now. \n\nInstead of forcing idealism of the mat, if your expericing will paralysis... Then dance in that by simply letting it be! It's grist for the mill of yoga sadhana. Don't attach and validate it, by fighting it or whatever is subjectively \"done\". It is a mere appearance in what you are, it can not truly touch This. If you can let all be without trying to force and control, then suddenly it's as though the leaves outside start to share wisdom towards how such limiting imprints of personhood came to be."

I think that's the big journey with yoga/mindfulness. Often I feel this deep peace after practice and I feel like I've made progress but I think the real progress is the long term relationship with your practice. It doesn't have to be consistent because we are such fluid beings.

There are so many reasons why I prefer in-person classes opposed to practicing at home with videos. Here are just a few reasons:\n\n* There is so much energy at in-person classes. It is extremely motivating. I actually love packed yoga classes! It is so motivating to be in a room with other people who are working on improving themselves too! The trick to enjoying classes is to let go of your ego and realize it is okay to mess up, it is okay to fail or fall out of a balance pose, it is okay to have good days and bad days. When you can recognize that you are going to yoga classes for yourself and no one else, it is easier to stop comparing yourself to others.\n\n* There are other people there to motivate you! When you attend an in-person class, the instructor is encouraging you and rooting for you! That is so much more enjoyable than listening to an instructor on a video saying \"great job, keep going\". \n\n* Additionally, if I practice at home with a video I don't feel I can push myself as hard as I can at a live class. At home, I'll allow myself additional breaks or I might quit when things get too difficult. \n\n* It's unpredictable! When I take an in-person class, I don't really know what to expect. Yes, I will know the style of class (i.e., vinyasa, yin, hatha), but I don't necessarily know what pose the instructor will cue! Variability in classes keeps yoga exciting!\n\n* Hot Yoga! It would certainly be challenging to simulate a hot yoga class at home =P\n\n* Instructors are there to offer cues, proper form demonstrations, and challenge you further! As an additional bonus, there are opportunities after class to speak directly with an instructor on how to improve X, Y, Z!\n\n* If instructors play music during class, that also offers an element of surprise and variety to the yoga experience. I wont know what song to expect next!\n\n* Separate space for meditation. I like that I can leave my house (and the stressful thoughts I have at home - i.e., oh gosh, have to clean x,y, z!) and have a quiet space to practice at a studio class. The hustle and bustle at home, the distractions, the pets, etc.. all make for a less enjoyable yoga home practice. I guess I like that I can compartmentalize my yoga to a separate space and location.\n\n* The sense of community! Even if I don't talk to a single other person at my yoga studio, it is still VERY cool to see that so many other people from different backgrounds &amp; cultures (i.e., men, women, black, brown, white, purple, gay, straight, thin, curvy) receive the same satisfaction, joy, happiness, etc from yoga that you do! We all have something in common even if it seems that we have nothing in common."

Some poses will barely make your board move like child's pose. But any balance pose is challenging when your new to yoga, even more so, when you don't have a stable surface. Weather conditions also matter (no wind or wind, waves, etc), and the type of board you'll use (inflatables are lighter and shake more, for example).

And take your time, rest when necessary. \n\nAlso meditation is fantastic! But if your craving that physical workout then meditation alone probably won’t satisfy you.

For instance, Adi Shankara (8th century) says some of these practices can also be applied by Hatha Yoga practitioners to get the same results.

I’ve heard of level 2 authorised teachers who took 10 years to be able to lift up &amp; jump back! Luckily there’s lots of chances to try in Primary Series."

    "body": "&gt;The first step to deepening that pose would be to draw knee over ankle, creating a 90 angle where shin/knee/thigh meet, and to make sure you're squaring your hips towards the front of the mat. That allows the hips to drop/move and the stretch to deepen in the hip flexors.\n\nI agree. I've actually made an incredibly [indepth video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NITPD0beV74) on those ideas, going even beyond those suggestions and exhausting every cue you can possibly implement to deepen the stretch.  (posterior pelvic tilt, squaring, back leg aligned with the mat and so on)\n\n&gt;Try it, honestly. I just got on my mat and went into crescent as he did with my knee set back from my ankle. As soon as you move the hips forward to align the knee over ankle you can feel the stretch more, especially in the psoas.\n\nI'm saying when you want to lengthen the stance, the knee isn't going to be perfectly over the ankle. Should one drive the knee forward? Absolutely. But just because the knee is not perfectly over the ankle isn't a big deal nor is it bad for the knee.\n\n&gt;The guy isn't wrong about the length of the stance affecting the stretch, but it seems odd to worry about the length before focusing on that alignment point and potentially destabilizing the pose.\n\nThat guy is me. And this video is not for beginners. It's for people who understand the basic cues and alignment and want to go beyond it. Why is there so much combativeness when it comes to moving beyond the basics?"

    "body": "I think the methodology of doing five minutes of poses on one side is just something that evolved as yoga became more flowy and focused on the physical workout. It's by no means traditional, and by that I mean there's no reference to it before a few decades ago. Ashtanga vinyasa is the most flow-like of the traditional styles, and even those poses are done on one side, then the next.\n\nDoubtful that you can say \"xx number of poses on one side is bad for you,\" as it totally depends on the length of hold, the intensity of the practice, and the practitioner's physical capabilities. I personally don't like practicing this way, and even though I have a very strong practice, I tend to get tired very quickly and sometimes even get cramping in my hips when I do long flows like this. So I generally don't do them.\n\nThere's a lot of benefit in connecting some poses that have similarities in their shapes. For example, I often teach a little sequence of triangle &gt; side angle &gt; half moon, which challenges the hips and torso to stay open during the transition and can therefore bring more depth in one's awareness of these poses. It's a common grouping of poses from Iyengar yoga, but it seldom gets much longer than that."

Each day will be different (e.g. nausea/heartburn during forward folds, exhaustion, feeling off balance as the belly grows). But pregnancy has significantly improved my practice for this reason. It has forced me to be extremely aware of where my body is at any given moment. So keep doing what you’re doing!\n\nAs for modifications, there wasn’t much I’m not able to do. The big ones for me are opening twists (instead of closed twists) and staying out of the hot classes. I was able to do postures on my back until about 28-30 weeks when the weight of my belly became too much. Many of these I now do with a bolster/pillow so I’m not totally flat. Also around 25 weeks I switched out cobra for upward dog and never fully laid on my stomach. Some folds and bends became pretty difficult towards the end of third trimester but not a big deal. \n\nFinally try a prenatal class! I dismissed them as “too easy” at the beginning too. But there is value in occasionally slowing down and tuning more into breath (as opposed to pushing the body through super athletic classes). You can also modify the ‘prenatal’ postures to make then more challenging (eg rest in downward dog instead of child’s pose)."

You may have an anterior pelvic tilt, which means that when you stand, the top portion of your pelvis tips forward instead of staying vertical. There are many causes of this, including weak abdominal muscles, tight hip flexors, or a combination of those problems. Yoga can help with both. Before you jump into yoga hoping for a change, work with a physical therapist or doctor to determine the reason for the arch in your back.\n\nPlease keep in mind that some arch in the lower back is natural and desirable. If you have a healthy back, you should have three natural curves. Not having any curve in the lumbar spine can be a sign of posterior pelvic tilt, which is also a problem."

The truth is that it looks simple enough and most beginners do it incorrectly with weight in the wrong places and get sore quickly. The weight shouldn't be in your shoulders. \n\nTry starting in plank with your knees down on the ground. This is modified plank and you can take it during the practice instead of plank. Hold your core strong even while you're doing modified. Have your hands firmly into your mat with the pads of your fingers pressing in, thumbs pointing towards each other. Lift your hips and push your butt behind you, this will look strange but you will be up on your arms with your knees bent and your bottom sticking out pretty far. Try to push your head towards your knees/crotch. Relax your shoulders up your back. Then slowly straighten your legs. They don't have to be all the way straight. If you feel the weight shifting into your shoulders and hands, keep the knees more bent.

She told me before class she might have to skip some poses (I appreciate the heads up so I don’t get concerned someone hurt themselves if they suddenly drop to child’s pose for 10 minutes in the middle of class). I told her it didn’t matter if she spent half the class in child’s pose if that’s what was working for her body and it sets a great example to other students to meet themselves wherever they are that day. So for a few months she would take shavasana halfway through the class. She eventually worked her way up to doing the whole class but still regularly skips poses."

I have eased into asanas very gradually over this last year in small increments, and that's practicing for at least a half hour most days of the week. There are definitely poses I couldn't access until my body changed, which happened with satisfying consistency over time. I adapted by doing things like widening my knees in child's pose, not attempting eagle-arm binds until I lost some extra me, and not assuming body-weight-holding challenges like side plank until later.\n\nI'm not beginning to suggest that getting smaller/losing weight is, or needs to be, on your agenda. For me, it was unavoidable, and at almost-fifty y.o., I feel it's been great for my comfort and mobility. But try not to push yourself into injury, which can be easier when you've got some issues around excess flesh. It's all such a lovely adventure, and I hope you're enjoying your body and your journey as it unfolds! Also, by the way, there's a lovely yogi on Instagram named Jessamyn who has an app called underbellyyoga.

So, like, seated warm up, sun salutations, standing poses, balance poses, backbends, hip openers, forward folds, twist, savasana.

I've been doing yoga for many years and have always thought I had good chaturanga form and my form is consistent with \"correct posture\" photos online, but I think something is happening during the transitional movement from high plank into chaturanga.\n\nFrom high plank, with stacked shoulders above wrists, I move forward/roll forward on my toes and then I go down into the chaturanga position with my elbows hugged in close to my ribs. I like to think I am going down to a 90 degree bend in my elbows, but now I've been wondering if perhaps I have been bending my elbows too far. I'm thinking my shoulders are collapsing or rolling down towards the floor. My shoulders are not shrugged up to my ears. Should I be thinking about bringing the medial margins of my scapulas together? I think these medial scapula edges are separating away from each other and I am possibly going into a sort of \"cat position\" with rounding shoulders while in chaturanga.\n\nThanks for your response.

It is a preventative measure against hernia and also helps to relieve piles. It increases the efficiency of the entire digestive system, relieving stomach ailments such as hyperacidity and peptic ulcer. It reduces the blood flow to the genitals and massages the nerve fibres which feed them, making it useful in the treatment of dilated testicles and hydrocele in men. It assists women in labour and helps alleviate menstrual disorders.\n\nVajrasana is a very important meditation posture because the body becomes upright and straight with no effort. It is the best meditation asana for people suffering from sciatica and sacral infections."

I hate to use this term, but the general\nConsensus is medical providers should only test if there are signs of hypogonadism: sexual deficiency, loss of body hair ( not growing a beard at 18 doesn’t count) and other things like gynecomastia.  There are pretty strict guidelines to drawing the labs and a bit loser guidelines in interpreting them.   And as far as actual therapies well the full spectrum is present on this one.   If you think your T is actually low at your age this requires a real discussion with your physician and if he/she recommends therapy I would get a second opinion.  \n\nThat being said yoga isn’t magical even though it is wonderful.  Wt loss and exercise can boost Testosterone if you’re grossly over weight or sedentary.         \nBut whether this is you is impossible to do outside of the clinical setting.  I don’t know you or your conditions but I personally would not recommend ( ethically or legally) of giving another wise healthy 18 yo testosterone injections.   As an 18 yo male your still maturing physically even thought you may feel like a grown man.  Personally I couldn’t grow a good beard till I was in my late 20s and now I have to shave 2x a day.  So don’t worry about that variable it will either happen or not.  If possible ask your father about his facial hair development; good chance you’re will be similar even though not identical. \n\nAs far as adding mass there are a plethora of work outs that can help you.  That being said there is a big difference between the mass of an O lineman, a lacrosse defender, and a power lifter.  You’ll have to figure out what you want and go from there.  I can tell you as a lean 200lbs man carrying mass is not all it’s cracked up to be.  Find what’s right for your frame and maximize that.  Hope this helps and doesn’t ramble too much.  \n\nEnjoy the adventure of fitness. Keep up the yoga your body will thank you as you move beyond the 3rd decade."

He should respect your personal space after you tell him to not touch you. It is a serious problem if he does not respect your request.\n\nI have one yoga teacher who gives adjustments. For example, when I am in downward dog she gently uses both hands on my lower back/upper butt and like pushes up my back in a really tender way. It’s nice because it helps me elongate and straighten my spine. I could see how the adjustments coming from a man that you feel chemistry with would be distracting and feel wrong. Hell, the first time she adjusted me I felt a bit weird. I’m not a touchy person.\n\nThe point of yoga is to feel present, so if him touching you is distracting you from feeling present, you can go without."

Old people settle into a routine better than anyone, have money to spend, and understand the importance of “use it or lose it”. They buddy up with the other old people. They’ll never miss a day. \n\nThere will always be pregnant moms, they love these classes as a social gathering place. They meet other moms, and the babies “make friends”. It’s like Gymboree for the wellness moms. I’ve also seen evenings do really well with the pre-natal. Like 5 pm yoga for expecting moms.\n\n\n\nTiming matters:\n\n6 am, 6:30 am, 7 am. Type A people. They want Power Flow and/or Ashtanga.\n\n8 am, 9 am are the Warm Vinyasa crew. \n\n12 pm, 12:30 pm are the lunch people, Vinyasa and Slow Flow do well during these times.

While things are getting rolling it will be slow, sell CBD products in the lobby to help keep you afloat.\n\nAlso, people don’t want to be the only one in class. If a new person shows up and there’s no one else there, it’s gonna be tough to retain them. So try to establish a base crew who shows up to all the classes. Have all your teachers coming to class multiple times a week, let them bring their friends. Get some bodies in there so people enjoy the experience, once the new people are consistently coming back, you can phase out the free people and it’ll keep itself going."

    "body": "I appreciate your open self-examination. That's admirable. \n\nYoga is neither a workout nor a system of stretching. You can get both of those things out of yoga, but ultimately that isn't what it is. Yoga is a whole person practice for total wellbeing. This includes your mental/emotional/spiritual as well as your physical. That being said, I'm not gatekeeping here, and there is no need to become a kirtan chanting, devotional yogi to be able to do yoga. I am just telling you that yoga is there to take care of ALL of you. \n\nAs far as shavasana goes- relaxation is just as important as physical activity. We need to have moments in our day where we are not \"doing\". Cultivating stillness is crucial to mental wellbeing, and it sounds like you could use some. \n\nRichard Rosen, yoga journalist, says, \"Surrender any and all psychological effort (or at least as much as you can). Even as you lie still on the floor, you'll discover that you're still trying, wondering what to \"do\" in this posture. Drop your brain to the back of the skull. Remember the words of the great sage Abhinavagupta: \"Abandon nothing. Take up nothing. Rest, abide in yourself, just as you are.\"\n\nAnd BKS Iyengar, founder of Iyengar Yoga has this to say, \"By remaining motionless for some time and keeping the mind still while you are fully conscious, you learn to relax. This conscious relaxation invigorates and refreshes both body and mind.\"\n\nSavasana is often used as a form of practicing mindfulness. Here is an article from the American Psychological Association on the effects of that: \nhttps://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/07-08/ce-corner\n\nAll that being said, I too have suffered from anxiety for many years. Meditative practices and anything that cultivates stillness is hard for me- and I have a seated meditation practice. It can be so hard for me to just be! But it has helped me immensely with many of the things I struggle with, and many of the things you listed in your OP. Stillness and mindfulness is a tonic for our minds and our bodies. \n\nI hope this has helped a bit. ��"

In sloka 55, three types pranayama are mentioned for this purpose which nowadays I take it are referred to as abdominal breathing, thoracic/mid-chest breathing, and clavicular/upper-chest breathing - with the complete breath as a combination of all three. Here, I assume there is an equivalence in mastery of udana (up breathing) with uttama (high breathing) practices.\n\nIf levitation is said to be attended with the third type, we might speculate that the first kind might be attended with the experience of levitation/flying in dreams as a sign of success on the first level. Some writers associate astral projection with the second and third type as a possibility. Anyone ever have levitation/flying in connection with first?\n\n**Gheranda Samhita**\n\nSris Chandra Vasu (1895 transl.):\n\n&gt;55 - By practicing the lowest pranayama for sometime, the body begins to perspire copiously by practicing the middling, the body begins to quiver (especially there is a feeling of quivering along the spinal cord). By the highest pranayama one leaves the ground i.e., ***there is levitation***. These signs attend the success of these three of pranayama.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;56 - By pranayama is attained the ***power of levitation*** (Khechari S'akti), by  pranayama diseases are cured, by pranayama the S'akti (spiritual energy) is awakened, by pranayama is obtained calmness of mind and exaltation of mental powers (clairvoyance, &amp;c.); by this, the mind becomes full of bliss; verily the practitioner of pranayama is happy.\n\nJ Mallinson (2004 transl.):\n\n&gt;56 - The signs of success are threefold: in the lowest, heat is produced; in the middle, the spine shakes; and in the highest, the yogi leaves the ground.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;57 Through pranayama, the yogi gets the ability to move through space; through pranayama, diseases are destroyed; through pranayama, Shakti is awakened; through pranayama, manonmani arises. Bliss arises in the mind and the practitioner of pranayama becomes happy."

    "body": "\\&gt; I think it really has to do with my diaphram.  \n\n\nI doubt the diaphragm is the cause of all the issues and though practicing correct breathing is very beneficial, it's probably not going to fix a scoliosis or realign the legs. Maybe you were born with a mild scoliosis, maybe you naturally developed bad posture from sitting too much which would cause a tight ribcage and thus make your accessory breathing muscles over-work....who knows. In terms of rehabilitating your body it's not important.  \n\n\n\\&gt;I seem to not have great intra abdominal abdominal pressure and I think that's where my problems come from.\n\nIf you have a tight ribcage, you probably have a tight lower spine. The abdominals/obliques are stabilizer muscles to the spine, they switch off and sag when the spine is tight, giving a bloated, saggy look, it's normal. Usually accompanied by tight, strong hip flexors and weak glutes/hamstrings.   \n\n\nFrom what you've said I'm not sure if holding your breath will give much benefit.  Unless you have been advised by a specialist, I would switch the breath holding to taking long exhales instead, it will help calm the mind and encourage the correct firing pattern of your breathing muscles.   \n\n\n[Here's a Pilates breathing playlist on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_wl5zWp6tk&amp;list=PLkjZYZHLQmzFt6WmiRPxYrl7EMmmOB1Gc&amp;index=2). Be gentle with yourself, during the breathing exercises there's no no need to squeeze your core tightly, imagine you are stood in water and the water pressure is aiding the exhale...it will make sense when you practice it.  \n\n\nThere's a lot of fake Pilates on Youtube so if you want to delve deeper, I recommend [pilatesanytime.com](https://pilatesanytime.com), it's a subscription service, use code BLACK for 30 free days. On their website, have a search for 'scoliosis' or other issues you want to learn more about. Be sure  to practice some of their [beginner playlists](https://www.pilatesanytime.com/program-view/8/Pilates-Program-The-Starter-Series)  beforehand, it will teach you how to incorporate correct breathing with core control,  the core being every muscle attached to the lower spine and pelvis. The abdominal play a minor roll in a strong core.\n\n[pilatesology.com](https://pilatesology.com) is another good website, use code REDDIT30 for a free trial.  \n\n\nGood luck with the Doctors, if you don't have much success with them I would seriously consider  having  a lesson at a Clinical Pilates studio where a professional can teach you how to breathe correctly and sync it with movement to help you overcome your knee pain/tight ribcage. Message me anytime if you want advice finding a good studio/teacher."

Essential oils I use so a) students realize I'm approaching for an adjustment and b) as kind of antibacterial protection from student to student. \n\nIf I can ask, what do you think would be the best way to address this?

    "body": "This must be so stressful, especially in the one place that should be a sanctuary. Your boss is a bully, and she’s abusive. Yelling at you, embarrassing you, slapping and pushing you during class? That’s really unacceptable, and it sounds like no one has called her out on it. She shouldn’t be a teacher of any kind. Is there anyone higher you could speak to about this, to whom you could describe what’s happening, as you have here? It’s important to be supported in this situation because it sounds very isolating. (And btw, it might be a good idea to keep a record of any further incidents.) Or, maybe you and some others would be able to approach her as a group, for mutual support? Even if you do decide to cut your losses and move on, which I do think you ultimately should, I’d very much hope that she is confronted directly about her behaviour. If you feel able to confront her yourself - though I know that may not be easy - then do try to get someone to be there with you, perhaps the favourite teacher you mention (although, ‘She does it because she likes you’ is terrible reasoning and doesn’t mean you should keep putting up with this!). Tell her that you’re unhappy with how she has approached you in class and that it needs to stop. Be specific. ‘Several times you have yelled at me, and even slapped and pushed me in class.’ And maybe: ‘I wish I had spoken up earlier, but to be honest I’ve been so taken aback that I wasn’t sure how to respond. This isn’t something I can continue to tolerate and I need to ask you to please stop.’\nAnd if she touches you again or embarrasses you in class, I think you should speak up sharply in that moment and leave the class, even if it feels uncomfortable. You’re not the one who has disturbed the practice - she is."

    "body": "&gt; More sutras please. \n\nThis sutra and the next, concerning the upbreath (Udana) and the midbreath (Samana), appear to make a pair, and could probably be commented on jointly. As prana is inhaled and diffused throughout the body, it is said to accumulate in the solar plexus (=Samana: midway between the heart and navel area). After it concentrates there to a sufficient degree, according to a Trika account, it expands into the medial channel (Sushumna) and rises into the head area (Udana) until it reaches the crown chakra.\n\nAccording to Swami Hariharananda Aranya, the effect of concentrated Samana on the body produces a luminous aura. While the effect from a refined form of an upward rising Samana that converts into Udana is a luminous lucidity. \n\nIt is assumed that the practice of pranayama is needed for producing the effects mentioned in these two sutras. But what is not obviously apparent is the role Dharana meditation might play. Here, the attention is anchored to the breath and is focused on the rhythmic inflows and outflows, with pauses in between, to the exclusion of distracting thought. Over a period of time, prana is expected to accumulate in the Samana and blossom into a golden flower-like radiance."

A good teacher will ask you if you have any health problems or old injuries and will modify postures to prevent injury. \nThe word yoga translates at union, yoke it bind and refers to the relationship between disciple (student) and guru (teacher) which Desikachar says is a lifelong relationship. As a teacher of music myself, in the western world where individuality and independence is valued, leaning about this was a revelation for me. Teachers are responsible for their students! Fortunately new buzz words are beginning to appear such as ‘interdependence’ and Eno coined a term ‘scenius’ to describe collective genius. Anyway, I’m digressing..... find a teacher!"

If it hurts during your session, you're likely not doing your body any good and you're going to be sore later. Traditional yoga videos aren't really built to understand the anatomy of an overweight person.\n\nFor example, I physically cannot fold my legs together in sukhasana, which makes floor work very uncomfortable. Since I've got some extra chunk behind my thighs and knees, if I try to force my body into that pose, it hyperextends my knees and causes pain. If I modify all those stretches so that the bottoms of my feet are together instead, I can still follow the video and just hope to be more flexible next time. And slowly you really do see a difference! I can do almost all of the standing parts of Adrienne's videos, and floor work is getting easier.\n\nGood luck to you :) be gentle and understanding of your body and the rest will come with time"

Starting at an all levels is a great place to start, because then you can kind of gage where you are. (In terms of how you feel doing each pose, general flexibility, where tight areas are, ect) What’s really important, and I would stress, is that yoga is a very personal sport.

    "body": "Hi, I know you're after Yoga advice, which I have little experience in but as nobody else has commented,  I thought my perspective as  a Pilates instructor might be of use.\n\nIt's possible there's a link between your posture  and depression/sleep issues.  When we feel stressed, our brains send a signal down our parasympathetic nervous system to any muscles that can aid in getting more air into the lungs, so muscles around the upper check and neck start firing. If the diaphragm can't get enough air into the lungs (for a variety of reasons such as tight ribcage), we never calm down, constantly stuck in fight/flight mode. We call this chest breathing, which is constantly sending a signal to the brain that you are in danger. It's a viscous cycle that  has lots of negative side-affects such as ruining the circadian rhythm and giving a feeling of anxiety, 24/7.\n\nYou've mentioned pain in one shoulder and flared ribs which are very common with people with a spine scoliosis. Do you get pain in one leg?  The hips/legs compensate when there's a scoliosis, Pain in one knee, shin splints, one ankle not sitting over the foot correctly are common.\n\nIn the UK, typically you go see a GP who might refer you to a plethora of specialist Drs such as EMT specialist, neurologist, physio department etc. It's important you go to everyone your Drs suggests to rule-out possible issues.\n\nTo answer your last question, I see lots of clients with rib deformities and all of them are using their accessory breathing muscles and so not breathing correctly. I'm concerned about your posture and so I think if you are going to continue Yoga, it should be with a qualified instructor that additionally has some physiotherapy qualifications."

At first you may not “get it”, you may not love it, you probably won’t be “good” at it; keep going. It’s a practice like anything else, it takes time and consistent practice. The time will pass regardless, so just keep showing up, and one day you’ll look back at how far you’ve come and you’ll remember the day that you posted here as one of the most positive changes in your life. \n\nYou can do it! Just gotta do it. I wish you the best."

If your hand can reach the floor easily, then it's fine but I think it's important that you don't just touch the floor just because you can. Your legs should be your  primary support and you shouldn't have weight into your hand, hence why we're often taught to back-off and not go that far.  Variations offered usually start from anywhere between resting elbow/ forearm on your knee, reaching for a block  or not using your hand  at all  for weight-bearing. We're often cued to take the back of our hand to press into the leg as a bit of a lever for extra chest rotation but that will all depend on where you are at and what your teacher is trying to encourage you to achieve that day."

Even though rolling out a mat is not hard, it's still just that one extra step that I can't dredge up the energy to do. \n\nSo my solution for this has been to develop a \"mat-less\" practice for those days. It is not as good or as complete as a full practice on the mat, but it covers the basic essentials and at the end of it I feel better. For this, I go to my yoga space (often drawing myself there by feeding the kitties which is right next to it) then just sit or stand on the floor and ease into it. Since I have wood floors, sometimes I even like the mat-less practice a little bit more as it feels like I am more \"connected\" to home than through mats. \n\nWhile I'm still not up to the daily practice I aim for, having the mat-less practice option means I do yoga more days than I don't, either on the mat or without."

However, the best way that I can describe it is to compare it to dreaming. I think that deep meditation experiences come from the same place as dreams. I don’t really hold much stock in them as being “real” or the way things “actually” are. I think it’s just our consciousness trying to reconcile consciousness. It’s very interesting, though!

Start small and build from there. Focus on what you \\*can\\* do.\n\nSome poses also just aren't accessible to bigger bodies.

They don't need to look good for anyone.  \nI sort of just found which products to use by trial and error, bought at the store and saw what leaked and what didn't.  \nBasically what I do is wear \"briefs\" during the night or if I know I won't be near a bathroom to change for a long time. Briefs is just a euphemism for diapers, super absorbant, tapes on the sides. During the day I wear stuff that's less absorbent but not so bulky--basically a pull-up. And that's what I wear to the gym. Compared to the briefs, it's discrete, at least I think so, and it's really just if the pull-up crawls up around the shorts' waistband that anyone would notice my bathroom issue.  \nBut what you mention might work better. But is it waterproof? I think it would have to be to work for my problem."

Normally I set it to 10-15 minutes, restorative, and that works great for stretching.  \n\nAnother great app that I used for a fair bit was not specifically yoga, but adjacent to it. It's [Stretchit](https://stretchitapp.com), and I found their full body program fantastic. Only a few of their videos for that were 15 minutes long, though, and I didn't have enough time to get more out of it. It's worth trying the free trial out to see if there's something that oculd help you though.\n\nAs for other mobility / flexibility options wise, I actually compiled my own playlist on YouTube, mostly yoga based, which you can check out [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_JpH1PX3hRt7sHSrmEis5b-ivkqEyjUH).

I mean, it's totally possible to lose weight in 30 days, sure... but why 30 days specifically? and then after the thirtieth day, what's next?\n\nI could be wrong though...

Also the yoga app I like to use is called down dog and has good beginners routines as well as just stretching routines. My hips also hurt a little in child’s pose but it’s eased as I’ve practiced more and I remember when I first started most poses were a struggle. You’ve gotta kind of know your body too I think, know what pain is wrong and what ‘pain’ is your body not used to being stretched or used in a particular way.\n\nI’d advise you to look up proper form to name sure you’re doing it right and then do the pose as much as possible, don’t push yourself if it’s painful.

Focus on studying the yamas and niyamas and the eightfold path. There are only 2 or 3 sutras on physical yoga postures for a reason.\n2) For kundalini - study the Chakras - Eastern Body Western Mind is my favorite book. Kia Miller on yogaGlo is my favorite kundalini teacher and they have intensive guided programs. It’s about a 20/month investment. \n3) Invest in a 200 hour yoga teacher training and teach as many newcomers as you can. You learn so much by being committed to teaching every week. “The student is the teacher,” - sorry - pretentious.\n5) Keep studying the Bhagavad Gita, the Gunas and Ayurveda. Keep it sattvic."

    "body": "Yoga could help you lose weight. There's a lot of variables, what type of yoga, how many hours per week. The more it incorporates strength building poses or components, the better weight loss you'll see. But yoga alone will never work as well or as fast as doing yoga along with other physical activities and proper nutrition. If you are looking to drop 10-20, it would be best to do more than yoga to get quicker results.\n\nIf you are looking to lose weight, I'd rank the following in order of importance.\n\n\t1. Nutrition\n\t1. Strength \n\t3. Yoga/Pilates \n\t3. Mobility/Posture\n\t5. Cardio\n\nThere's two ties there. Nutrition and strength work are equally important. As are doing yoga/pilates and some dedicated mobility and posture work. Cardio is last because for the amount of time you'd have to put in to measurably affect your weight loss, that time would be better spent (for long term benefit) on the other activities, especially since you seem to be just starting out. \n\nNutrition - If your diet is just awful, fixing this is actually your true numero uno priority (ahead of strength). If you think you eat pretty well, you could  probably make do with just some small steps in the right direction. Avoid sugar entirely. Reduce your intake a little if you think eat a bit too much. Avoid empty calories on unhealthy snacks. You don't want to eat too little though, because you're going to be doing strength/yoga/pilates, and you need to eat enough to help your muscles recover and grow.\n\nStrength - Doing strength work is very important, and it's like a triple threat. Its exercise that consumes energy while you're tearing down your muscles, your body will consume energy while its recovering from the exercise, and as you gain muscle your body will consume more energy on a day to day basis. Muscle burns more energy than fat. You want to try to do strength work from head to toe, so your entire body is becoming stronger, and burning through more energy every day. \n\nYoga/Pilates - Creates body awareness, increases mobility, incorporates strength work, helps with balance, provides amazing feedback on your body's weaknesses and helps to measure your own personal growth. The strength work you'll perform often targets different muscles and movements than traditional bodybuilding type strength work (stabilization, obscure and small muscle groups, etc.)\n\nMobility/Posture - When you do dedicated mobility/posture work, you are complementing the strength/yoga/pilates work you are already doing, and it allows you to get more out of it. Increasing the range of motion performed in exercises/poses or creating better form will yield better results. When it comes to posture, you can make changes to how you hold/move your body during the other 16+ waking hours a day that you aren't exercising, and maybe even alleviate some pains or imbalances. Mobility work can also help to improve body mechanics for any cardio activity you may choose. \n\nCardio - Good for your heart, helps your lungs, helps train endurance for strenuous activities, but it's really just a one-time calorie burn. I'd consider it optional. But if there's a cardio activity you enjoy, want to work towards a motivational long term goal, or you just like being outdoors, do it!"

It's a responsibility and a privilege to hold space for others in this practice, and your teacher is abusing the position- I feel certain you are not the only one here. I hope you reach out to the studio employing him- at the very least. I also think since you are now in a big city, you ought to try some new studios- this hopefully won't happen again, because it is definitely abuse- it is in no way your fault, and it is meant to never happen."

    "body": "In my experience, one side will always be better than the other, no matter how good you get. And it sounds like you're already trying to do all the things, but a few to check out if you haven't already:\n\n- Notice how you build the shape differently from one side to the next. Are there elements that just fall into place on one side that you can consciously fine-tune on the other? \n\n- Related - are you really, fully engaging the core and all of the supporting muscles on the weaker side? Are you as tall on the weaker side as the stronger one? \n\n- Are you consciously setting the standing foot on the weaker side? The stronger side typically doesn't need it, it just does the right thing. ;) \n\nThe other thing is, really, that the teachers are right. I struggled with balance until I decided it wasn't the big issue I was making it. As long as you're in your head about this, it's likely to continue to be an issue. Balance used to be what made or broke my practice - which often ended up in an otherwise perfect class ending with me being very cranky because I couldn't stand on one foot that day. Then I realized how very ridiculous that was, and it was the turning point. It was not a one-time epiphany, but it made a difference pretty quickly and it took comparatively little time for me to be able to stand forever on one side. The other is still weaker, but that side is 'almost forever' in most cases. And even after 20+ years there are days where standing on one foot with any grace is just not going to happen."

You'll need to come forward a bit to manage this. A chaturanga is not merely lowering your body halfway to the floor. Do not be afraid to lower your knees to ensure that you can maintain proper form.\n\nWhen I'm in plank, my arms are straight and my hands are under my shoulders. My toes and the balls of my feet are on the floor, too. When I transition to chaturanga, I roll up to the tip of my big toes and bring my body forward while lowering it.

Make sure your knees are lower than your hips.   \n\n\nLOY is an amazing books, but the Iyengar knowledge and pedagogy has evolved with time, and I recommend you get the [preliminary course for beginners](https://www.amazon.com/Preliminary-Course-Beginners-Yoga-Action/dp/8187603011/ref=pd_sim_14_2/143-9518460-4776212?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=8187603011&amp;pd_rd_r=cc5c280b-f24a-405a-94a0-bee0c25d4bf2&amp;pd_rd_w=l1cwC&amp;pd_rd_wg=UuMiN&amp;pf_rd_p=90485860-83e9-4fd9-b838-b28a9b7fda30&amp;pf_rd_r=7H1M11CSWVRMRJDQKEYY&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=7H1M11CSWVRMRJDQKEYY) (and possibly the intermediate as well if you're interested) by Geeta Iyengar which is based on more current guidelines and understanding of alignment taught at the Ramamani Institute."

The distance between the elbows should be the same as the distance from your wrist to your elbow. Any wider and you're compromising your stable platform. The elbows should definitely be no more than shoulder width apart (keep in mind your shoulders in this sense are not measured to the outside of the shoulders but the joint.) You can get an idea of that with my measuring between the tops of the scapulae ([acromial process](https://imgur.com/IThGzor).) \n\nMy shoulders to the *outside* of the shoulders is about 23 inches, but the measurement between the tops of the scapulae is about 16 inches. For anyone new to salamba sirasa I recommend starting forearm width apart which seems to be about 2-3 inches narrower than the shoulder measurement for most people."

Some people will monitor their heart rate while exercising during pregnancy, but I just listened to my body. I think if your in tune with yourself and your practice, most of it is intuitive.

I had to stop giving blood in college  because I fainted a few times afterwards while still laying on the donation bed. They probably shouldn’t have taken my blood because the doctor has since confirmed that I’m pretty heavily anemic. I try to eat iron rich foods and drink lots of water to help.\n\nWhen I started yoga I would get faint every single practice. Vision would go out, I’d lose hearing, get dizzy etc. Childs pose is a great resting posture but even just forward folding is good. Anything that gets your head below your heart. I was discouraged at first because I thought I couldn’t do yoga, but I just let myself take the appropriate breaks when I needed to and kept up with it. I was always thin but had very little actual fitness, as I continued to do yoga my fitness improved, I learned how to breathe and my dizzy spells became less frequent. It still happens from time to time, especially when I’m not getting enough iron and water, but only maybe once a month.\n\n\nHopefully when you see a doctor they can let you know if you have any conditions that are increasing dizziness for you and once you know that you can take steps to compensate for that. But beyond that, if you are starting at a very low fitness level like I was, even with some sort of preexisting condition I do think you can expect your dizziness to get better as your fitness improves."

It is a group class, but it is still your own practice.  At the studio I currently go to, the one of the instructors often says something like, \"You can even stay in savasana for the whole hour if that's what you need today.\"  I'm currently 32 weeks pregnant, and I modify and take breaks all the time, since I go to regular vinyasa classes instead of prenatal.  There are others in the classes I attend who also modify and rest as needed.\n\nRegarding mirrors: almost every studio I've been to has at least one mirrored wall.  I don't now how much of a turnoff that is.  But like someone else said, the mirrors are not there for you to admire yourself.  I often use the mirror to make sure I am aligned properly because I tend to \"dump\" into my lower back for a lot of postures that involve more core work.  I wonder if you can practice (at home at first if you're more comfortable) using the mirror as a tool to help your practice rather than as a highlighter of flaws?"

    "body": "I've been doing yoga for a couple years but I also do a little calisthenics/bodyweight fitness. I am going to post some video resources below that are from that world vs straight yoga that you might find helpful and might not have seen before.\n\nBut a few things that come to mind:\n\nYour core might not be strong enough, particularly with compression strength. You need very active compression and bracing strength while you are simultaneously moving. It's a very specific type of core strength you might not have practiced or developed.\n\nThere is a balance element to it, your hips travel further back than normal to counterbalance the weight of your legs. As you raise your legs up, they return over your shoulders to the neutral position in the final headstand pose.\n\nReally stand high on your toes as you point your toes and raise your heel/ankle, helps to position the hip further back and higher.\n\nYou might need to stretch a bit beforehand to open yourself up in your hamstrings and hip flexors. Things get off if you're too tight on one of these sides. Warm up until you've increased your flexibility for a good forward fold / pike.\n\nYou need decent shoulder flexibility. Shoulder flexibility with a stable straight spine. When assessing your flexibility, make sure you arent getting your arms close to your head by arching your back.\n\nA few strategies to try:\nStart with easier versions. You didn't describe your arm placement for your headstand (ie on forearms or tripod on hands). To learn press, give yourself as stable a base as possible: Do tripod/bent arm. It's also easier to start with a straddle because it shortens the lever you are moving. You can also decrease the range of motion by starting with your feet elevated higher. Theres many different ways to incrementally increase the challenge, or isolate components that you need to work on.\n\nNegatives. A bodybuilding strategy where you concentrate on the negative motion of the exercise when it's too difficult to pull off. Jump or get to headstand however, then slowly slowly lower your legs in a slow controlled manner (slowly), as if doing the press. Gravity is your friend to make things easier, but you do your best to resist it and prevent any collapsing. Will help build same muscles needed for the exercise. \n\nSpecific exercises:\nCore. Lots of tuck / compression work. Some lengthened work like the hollow body position. See the tuck section of this Kino handstand guide https://www.yogajournal.com/practice/kino-macgregor-handstand-plan#gid=ci020756a6500e25bd&amp;pid=kino-credit-563a6954i \nGet to where you can transition from a lying tuck, extend arms and legs up (like legs up wall pose, then reach for but dont touch your toes), then lower legs and arms to hollow body (as low as you can go without your lower back arching up from floor i.e. disengaging from posterior pelvic tilt). Kind of a pilates type exercise.\n\nPike compressions and straddle compressions. Will help strengthen hip flexors and core. It's like active core compression plus mobility in one. Very important for training the press to handstand/headstand.\n\nVideo resources. These are actually from press to handstand videos but it's analogous, some videos even include them in their progressions. If you think you are lacking flexibility for any specific needed movements or muscles try searching YouTube for Bodyweight Warrior aka Tom Merrick aka u/MovementTom . Great stuff.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/R1iCQnAtveU\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1SpW7Mr4AgA\n\nhttps://youtu.be/cP_touxFXQ8\n\nEdit: I read through my response, and wanted to add and highlight one thing. You really want your pelvis to be engaged in a slight posterior pelvic tilt (PPT) throughout the exercise. At the start for the press, it will really make things easier on you. A severe anterior pelvic tilt might even make it impossible for you to lift up or get close enough. You want to roll your pelvis into a PPT and really engage the compression around your pelvic floor. I like to focus on maintaining tension at a point around 2 inches below my belly button (or above if you are upside down ;)  ). \n\nMy mental checklist for starting a press to headstand:\nStarting around downward dog. Prep base. Point toes. Drag toes as close as possible. Stand higher on toes. Position hips. Roll hips into PPT. Engage tension in pelvis and core. Lift up. \n\nThe rest is balance and continuing to extend and point, bringing hips back slightly forward over your shoulders as you rise, and maintaining your headstand."

I just adapt my practice to the space. Not every pose needs to be practiced every time, so I focus on those I can do. Maybe this means I'm not progressing to more challenging poses, but I still have room for improvement in the some ones.\n\nMore frustrating for me is not being able to work on any balance poses, due to the fact that I'm always on a moving surface."

I feel lucky to have practiced with people of all body shapes and sizes and over time I feel comfortable with my less-than-\"perfect\" body in classes because I love how it does yoga.\n\nIn hot yoga classes, I give less of a shit since we're all drenched in sweat, so I just practice in a light coverage compression bra and damn the nipple coverage.  In normal vinyasa classes, I sometimes layer two really soft bras to get more coverage. (I hate wearing shirts and I also hate underwires)."

You can slowly, steadily, and safely increase flexibility in the hamstrings through regular yoga practice and some stretching on your own.\n\nWhen you do forward bends, consider practicing with a block in front of you to place your hands on. That way you can practice with straight legs for a better hamstring stretch, but you won't be overdoing the stretch by trying to force yourself to touch the floor with straight knees.\n\nYou can also work on stretching one at a time at home instead of doing both in a seated forward fold. Bend one knee and think of attaching the sole of your foot to the inside of the straight leg. Then, do your seated forward fold over the straight leg. Keep some blocks or other props nearby to meet your arms/upper body where it lands."

It's fine to do both, but both need to be understood- and mastered- on their own terms. Ayurveda is not an extension of yoga (though the 2 are arguably closely related). \n\nAs with yoga, ayurveda programs are starting to become vogue, so 'reputable' is going to get muddy. Most people I know are studying closely with an existing, long-time practitioner as more of an apprenticeship or small group as opposed to a school turning out large numbers. Best to get involved in the community and find out who is reputable that way (much like finding a good yoga teacher)."

And the definition you provide contains a key point: \n\n&gt; intended for or likely to be understood by only a small number of people with a specialized knowledge **or interest.**\n\nYes, anyone can *seek* enlightenment, but at the end of the day, most people aren't going to make it, for a long list of reasons. Most people aren't going to make it far enough down the path to even seek it out, proving the label to be accurate. A precious few individuals recognize that enlightenment is actually the simplest thing in the world, and for the rest (who even have an interest which, let's be honest, it a small fraction of the people practicing yoga asana or even meditation at this stage of the game) it's a long and devoted path which isn't likely to result in success. \n\nSo yes, I think 'esoteric' is a perfectly valid description.

    "body": "One way you can use mindfulness is beginning to recognize that the craving for a substance, if it arises, is just a sensation in your body, which may have thoughts and feelings and stories surrounding that sensation. Allow yourself to just feel and observe these sensations and watch the stories as if it were a movie. Try to breathe and relax while being with the feelings.\n\nAs you're attempting to relax with these sensations present, see if they are changing in anyway. They could move, change shape, temperature, etc .... Whatever it is notice. See if you can continue to breathe and relax. See if your breath grows and covers more of your body. Trust yourself, be compassionate, go at a pace that feels safe to you.\n\nIn my experience if we have a lot of repressed energy in our body then on our journey to relax we may find that the sensations can grow more intense and we feel even more energy in our bodies. Use this energy for the productive habits you want to nurture. Walking, yoga, service, etc. Mind you, this isn't a way to distract you from the intense sensations, rather it's a way to use it.\n\nAlways take time to rest. Even something like meditation can be taxing if we have to deal with intense feelings and maintain our focus. It's easy to get lost in our heads to try and ignore the feelings, so cultivating concentration allows us to stay present and redirect the energy in a way that nurtures and serves our best interest and the interest of others. But always take time to rest .."

I know I always feel it in my arms when I focus on those in my practise. \n\nFor hamstrings, take it slowly and make use of blocks/blankets if you have them. You can try a seated forward fold, whilst sat on a folded blanket or block to give yourself some elevation. Whilst sat down, try to tilt your bum up before folding forward to give yourself a bit more of a stretch.

That may mean a 10-15 minute practice every day to start which may not seem like much, but it will add up over time. The same thing goes for your diet. Start with one small change and see how you feel. Perhaps keep a food log and start counting your calories. Write down how you feel at the end of the day and see whether there's a pattern. You may start to notice that on days when you practice yoga, choose healthy foods, and eat less than 2000 calories a day, you feel better than on days you don't. That will become motivation to do it again tomorrow. Good luck on your journey, take one step at a time, and don't beat yourself up if you make mistakes along the way. &lt;3"

I don't really take anything now, I'm working on maximizing my natural ability in order to learn about myself. But just because that's what works for me doesn't mean it works for everyone. \n\nI believe that we all have trouble focusing it's normal. My goal during meditation is exercising my focus in order to become more present. I feel like being present helps you make better decisions and helps you go through life in a more positive way since you have more control over what you think and how you feel."

But sometimes I just quietly reverse back to the \"old\" way. I've had teachers lambast me for this which just makes me lose my my respect. \n\nSo with your case, she should definitely stop interrupting your class and you should set boundaries there but both of you  also should acknowledge that yoga has lots of subtle (and not so subtle) differences. Also you should provide some sort of explanation as to why your method is more accurate, benifical, easier on the joints, better for alignment etc.\n\nDon't just say \"this is the right way, everything else is wrong\" - paraphrasing here \n\nShe enjoys your class and asked to stay on after you basically wanted to kick her out, that counts for something."

It’s a few hours outside of the city. \n\nThe food... my goodness...unbelievably delicious, mostly vegan (some eggs). BSR has incredible gardens, farms most of its own food, prepares everything from scratch every meal, and is minutes away from hot springs with free entry (!) that they transport you to as well. \n\nIf you’ve not found that perfect spot, I can’t recommend BSR enough. They have tiered accommodations (ie. the dorms are less expensive than the private room with the gorgeous jungle view). I found it very reasonable, about $120 or so (I can’t remember exactly) per night, all inclusive. \n\nI spent a few weeks in Bali and, before the trip, had been researching yoga/meditation retreats to visit during my trip. It was an absolute incredible experience (I was there for 3 nights), I was blown away, and I will definitely go again. I could go on and on (the library! the water meditation! the labyrinth meditation!)...let me know if you want more info"

It’s about bringing yourself back to the present as you take note of what comes to mind when you stop trying to control your thoughts. It’s about learning to enjoy your own company. It’s about getting to know your true self. It’s about ultimately not finding yourself boring.\n\nYoga asana (the physical practice of yoga), is a moving meditation and can help prepare the body to sit longer. \n\nI don’t mean this in a judgmental way, but I’m afraid it is going to sound that way. I mean it coming from a place of compassion. And please understand I’ve been where you are. Maybe you need yoga and meditation so that you can learn to be bored. Being bored from time to time is not a bad thing. Our creativity gets stimulated when we’re bored. Sometimes our best ideas flow out of boredom. We shouldn’t be entertained all of the time. Sometimes we also need to learn to enjoy our own company so that we can distinguish between alone time and feeling lonely."

And if I went to a therapist or doctor and told them about my depression and the first thing they suggested was yoga? I would feel invalidated like “just do a little yoga, you’ll be fine.” Which is a bit what I felt from your post. And also, usually before medication is involved talk therapy, which is evidence-based, is tried. Then medication is tried and thank goodness it alters my brain chemistry because that’s our current understanding of what’s wrong in a depressed brain. It’s not a terrible idea for people with mild mental stress to try yoga, but it’s insulting to people with severe mental illness to suggest a recreational activity be covered by insurance when most of us are paying through the roof for our treatment even WITH insurance."

They do physical, outdoors-types of jobs, run marathons and do yoga. None of them are severely affected, except the one that has a sedentary job.\n\nAs to what kind of yoga to do--I quit Iyengar because the longer timings seem to cause stiffness. Flow yoga works better for me. Obviously, as with most physical things YMMV.\n\nEdit: You sound like you might know something about medical things, and I appreciate the sympathy.

Very careful to not push into anything painful or dangerous.\n\nIs there a methodology to doing all one side before the other, rather than doing half of a long series of lunges, then the other, then repeat with the rest? Between warnings of asymmetrical poses and the fact that many other poses -- like forward and back bends, twists, pretzelly maneuvers -- get rests/pauses/shake/wiggle at end or between rounds, it seems weird that lunge-stretches not only get none, but have many done sequentially."

The most experienced and the least experienced don't get left behind cos the most experienced can do modifications to increase the challenge and the least experienced people can do modifications that make the poses more accessible to them, the teacher just needs to be sure to show the modifications since newer students won't know about them. When you do yoga at home by yourself, you tend to take it too easy on yourself and it's easy to just stop after like three poses cos you've got Netflix and YouTube right there. Having the dedication to actually leave your house and drive somewhere to do something builds discipline.

Calling someone fucking fragile and telling them to “get hard,” is not a tactful or appropriate way to motivate someone unless you know they respond well to extremely tough love.

Do your feet or the direction of your force have to adjust at all? \n\n\nWhen outside I almost prefer mat/towel-free.

Switching up the language you use to refer to your self and your practice can make a big impact. Instead of \"I can't balance in that pose\" try \"I'm in the process of learning balance in that pose!\"\n\nThe mirrors....whew. I feel you. When I first started yoga looking in the mirror was one of the hardest things, but a funny thing happened after a while. I would watch myself struggle and sweat and even cry sometimes, day in and day out, pose after pose, class after class, the noise in my head just got quieter and quieter. I felt stronger and stronger. after some more time, a voice replaced the old one, and it just said....I love you. \n\nAfter many years, sometimes I can hear the I LOVE YOU loud and clear, and other days I really have to dig deep to hear it, but as long as I keep up the good work, it's always there. I know the yoga is always there for me, through big life events and tragic ones. \n\nMy advice? Look in the mirrors. Fall in love. Even if it is painful, ESPECIALLY if it is painful. This body is your **home**. Yoga is regular maintenance, not just for curb appeal. Inside and out.  \n\nYour best is enough. Show up as often as you can, do the best that you can, let the rest fall into place! :)\n\nBra tops!

I addressed your saying this:\n\n&gt;tight hamstrings do not contribute to back pain.\n\nThis is a statement you made. I'm not quoting someone else, or taking you out of context. Your incredibly long response to me has nothing to do with what I actually addressed.

Yin isn't fast paced at all so you end up stretching everything out, without being puffed out. After doing it for a few months, I found that when I did do a fast paced yoga style, I found it easier because I'd already done the groundwork in yin yoga. But that's just my experience, yours may be different.\n\nGood luck and fuck anyone who says yoga is only for slender people.

    "body": "it’s not fear mongering. i’m offering you a better grasp, especially if you’re making a youtube series about it. pushing exercise or not, regardless, the lats (among others) are dynamically stabilizing the shoulder, and if there is improper engagement this effects the rotational ability of the shoulder scapular gliding, which then puts extra pressure on the rotator cuff, which over time, can lead to a repetitive strain injury, or a torn rotator cuff, etc etc. \n\nit’s a matter of creating a poor eccentric load, and then subsequently limiting your power on the way back up. the way down on a push up is VASTLY more important than the way back up. do it with a slight internal rotation and you will mold the fascia along that tendency, which can lead to a cascade of issues, especially to aging populations and people with prior history of injury, or hypermobility. \n\nalso, nothing in the body functions in isolation. every single joint and muscle activates in all 3 planes of motion...even things like elbows and knees. you’re right about the push focus, but you are stabilizing all throughout the body, especially the back. it is important to know where this occurs, and how it relates to the movement at hand. this is pretty standard chaturanga cueing, look it up if you’d like."

    "body": "I also have no relevant experience, but I wanted to share something I learned from a rock climbing gym near me. I always thought that climbing gyms were just climbing gyms--you go and climb for a while, then leave. Then I started going to a new gym.\n\nThis climbing gym had a cafe that served food and beer, a gift shop, regular gym equipment, tons of comfy chairs and chill places to hang out, ping pong tables, and an outdoor hangout space with hammocks and tables/chairs. They brought in bands for weekly evening events during the summer. They had college night, women's night, kids night etc with discounts for those groups each week. \n\nHaving all of this stuff turned the climbing gym into a lifestyle; people would come and literally spend an entire day and night there. They would work out, then head to the cafe to work on their laptop in a quiet corner and have coffee, then they would climb, then they would do a fitness class, then have dinner, then go to the evening concert. They would bring their friends to climb and then kick back for a beer. It was honestly crazy how much time (and money) people spent at this place. It wasn't in a good location (it was a more industrial/not residential part of town), but people went out of their way to be there.\n\nWith a large enough space, I think some of this could help turn a yoga studio from just a studio into a community space (for the price of a class), and help you make a profit! You don't have to start with everything right off the bat--maybe just have yoga classes and comfy chairs first, then add a cafe and hangout spaces, then whatever you want: could be a daycare/childcare, or a bar, or meditation and therapy offices.\n\nI'm glad you're so excited about this! I wish you the best of luck!"

(some people seriously do not realize this. some crazy tone deafness)\n* watch everyone else if you're unsure of a pose. you can generally pick out who knows what they're doing. if a bunch of people are doing the same thing, it doesn't necessarily mean it's right, but it's probably a safe bet to follow them especially if the instructor doesn't correct it. there's a whole spectrum from absolutely wrong to absolutely perfect for any pose, and as long as you're above the \"I'm going to injure myself\" level, it's good enough for a beginner\n* bring water. drink when thirsty, and be careful about kicking over any bottles and making a loud noise\n* but don't drink a lot, or eat a lot, maybe within one hour of and during the class. everyone's different, but having a full stomach makes physical activity funky for some\n* get there early. register, sign waivers, etc.\n* don't be a bad customer. if you misunderstood something or didn't bother to read what you signed, that's on you; if you owe money, you owe money. if the staff can't do something, the staff can't do it. there isn't some gigantic secret society running an elaborate conspiracy to cheat you out of $2\n* yes it's fine to just sit, generally. I've only heard of bikram yoga being really strict about students not following along with everyone else. yoga is kind of the total opposite from a boot camp-style class. if you need a break, just take it\n* wear clothes that don't show your private parts. had a guy come into our studio once with loose shorts and no underwear or lining... people behind him were not happy\n\nhave fun, good luck"

Those who are not able to take their hands from their eyes need a guide to move them. Are you the ashtanga teacher that drags a new guy in off the street that can't reach to his knees and tells him to get into supta konasana? Because I tend to give you credit for being smarter than that. Teachers teach those who seek it, and they teach what the student is ready for at that time, based on their lineage. Yes, some lineages have rules with regards to how teachings are disseminated, but there are also reasons for that. The best teachers **always** want their students to achieve greater things than they themselves were able to, and they understand that it's a global work, not an individual one. I'm repeating myself here - people have to want to be enlightened, and for most it's hard work. Pretty quotes don't change that.

  {
    "body": "I agree with your general perspective here, but I do also think this instructor needs some correction on his behavior.  \n\n\nIn a situation which involves physical contact that is supposed to be instructive and professional, not sexual, I think the instructor has an ethical responsibility to make the separation between instruction and romantic advances explicitly clear. You should never have to wonder, during a yoga class, if you are just being \"adjusted\" because the instructor wants to put their hands on you, and I feel like the overly-subtle way he's going about flirting with OP is shady.\n\nGiven the physical nature of their relationship as instructor and student, I think the ONLY appropriate way to initiate anything romantic or flirty would be to do it explicitly, and with an easy out for the person being pursued, should they not be interested. This would open an opportunity to discuss how this might (or, ideally, wont) impact classes moving forward. This whole situation would have been WAY less awkward if he had just asked her out for coffee or something after one of the classes. The grey area only invites misinterpretation, and really puts everyone in a risky situation. \n\nIf his hands were to linger during an adjustment, would OP be crazy at this point to think that there might be something sexually motivated in the gesture? No, I don't think so. Does that mean that every time this instructor touched her, he was doing it for his own gratification? No, I don't think so. This sounds like a recipe for a situation in which one individual feels sexually harassed, and the other has no idea they've done anything wrong.  \n\n\nAll of this is to say--I think it would be worth at least dropping him a note to tell him that the way he interacts with you on social media has made you feel like your relationship as instructor/student is less than professional, and so you no longer feel comfortable attending his classes. You don't need to accuse him of anything, because he hasn't really *done* anything explicitly wrong. Based on what you've said, I think it is *likely* that his intentions were innocent, but that doesn't mean their execution was appropriate. Addressing it with him directly would also give him the opportunity to re-consider his behavior, and maybe approach this kind of situation differently in the future (which would be to EVERYONEs benefit)"

I'm a college math tutor, and there are no rules about me dating students, but I would never ask a student out or flirt with them overtly, even if I suspect they might be interested. The only time I've dated a student was when they asked me out, and even then I had to be very clear about boundaries, letting then know that I would treat then no differently in the learning space and that they would be welcome to come to me for help regardless of the outcome of our dating.

Some people enjoy the 1 on 1, other people don’t want that much attention, while other people feel bad that they’re “taking up the teacher’s time” (those people I assure them that I’m happy to be there with them and not to feel bad).\n\nI’ve taught many classes to 1 person. It’s almost always a nice experience for both parties, they’re very appreciative that I’ve spent the time and energy to help them, and it’s rewarding to be able to help them with their specific needs.\n\nIt’s can be nice as an every now and then type thing. But if someone signs up to take “classes” and every single time they show up they’re the only one, eventually they’re going to stop coming. Even if the experience is enjoyable, no one wants to be the only student every single time. Like you said it’s happened twice. Would you still enjoy it if it was every class you went to? When a new studio is starting up, it can literally be every class like that. \n\nFrom the teacher side, it’s not a great feeling to have the uncertainty of “Will I have 1 student today? Will I have any students at all?” A good yoga teacher values their own time, if they charge $60-80 for a private yoga session and they’re getting 1 student and making $15, they aren’t going to be sticking around for long. As much as I’m happy and willing to teach a small class, it’s more fun to teach larger classes for both the teacher and the majority of the students.\n\nTo sum up, I totally get your perspective, but I don’t think the majority of people want to be in that position on a regular basis."

But as several people commented: So what. Who cares if people know?  \nI looked up those shorts you mention online, I'm not sure if they handle the waistline.  \nI don't want to be obsessive about it, but I do want to be discrete.

Trade one out for the other from time to time, yoga classes can also serve as a good stretch on rest days. I would recommend committing to going to 10 classes at an actual studio over the span of 6-8 weeks, be patient with yourself and commit to completing 10 classes and you will feel lighter on your free and more aligned in your running form by the end of it. Spending that time upfront with an instructor to get you started will also set you up for making better use of online videos or having your own home routine, etc in the long run.\n\nBest of luck!"

I'm usually too sweaty and don't want other people's sweat and perfume on me from your hands so offering a gracious out is always appreciated.\n\nI really like when a teacher has enough awareness of how students are setting up their mats and helps with simple announcements to please make room or how best to align mats if it is a crowded class.  Also, when they have what props will be needed up at front so we know or announce it during coming in....letting everyone know after we are all on our mats sitting there ready to begin...then all have to get up and jockey for space to get props is just unnecessary.

Unless it's an extremely small class, you won't have time and people know that. \n\nWarm-up.

It depends on the person and your age. Particularly if you have a history of dieting, and you’re past a certain age, you may have an efficient metabolism.\n\nWhat you’re trying to do is consistently eat a similar amount and then burn more calories than you take in.\n\nFor burning calories, look at High Intensity Interval Training with yoga. I really like Alo Moves.\n\nAlso, it’s better to alternate kinds of cardio.\n\nI get plantar fasciitis in my feet, which can make running an issue.  A Czech doctor, who was a former ballet dancer, told me to try walking with ski poles; it burns 400-500 calories an hour, and it’s non-impact.\n\nIf you walk for an hour and a half at that rate, a few times a week, you should lose your twenty pounds in about a year."

Nothing to be ashamed of, and you can handle it.  No one judges you because we in the yoga community all learn that we do not need to wait on anyone else, because we ignite the changes within.  We are individually the ones that can lead us to our better selves : we are the ones we are waiting for.\n\nStruggle through your feelings, and don't get hung on the past.  Your eyes are in front to look forward.  Stop looking back : there is nothing for you there.  Your fears and feelings are natural, and will come out when u practice.  Just tell yourself that it will pass, that it is emotional trauma Lea IMG your body, and that you are okay.\n\nWe are the sum of all our tears.  Too many, and the best of us is washed away.

This is key. Every change we implement in health services usually does something unexpected. In this case - insurance companies want to spend less money. So you could easily see them pushing people who need more expensive treatment into a course of yoga first, to try to screen them out. This would be good for some; not good for others.

Not only does the community nature give me a bit of motivation (people will notice when I'm gone), bit the *thinking* part of the session is almost completely off-loaded to the instructor.\n\nStarting out, I might not need anything more than one of those two-year newbie instructors.  They're likely to push me just as much as anyone else is, because I'm still figuring out basic poses, the flow between them, and dealing with mobility issues that comes from a lifetime of mediocre living.\n\nSo...  Maybe have tiers on the classes?  Into classes with new instructors *might* be a way for people who've never tried yoga to check you out without they premium price point that more experienced instructors require.  And those premium prices, where I live?  Those kept me from trying for a few years, until I got a good deal at my work gym.\n\nAs always... know your customers and community.

Basically our lesson was don't worry about the pregnant person, as they're not going to keel over, if anything is wrong it'll come on slowly (like, dizziness) and they can stop, she'll feel a twist is uncomfortable, and back out, pregnancy is not a disease, she isn't an invalid, etc. \n\nNot a doc, not an expert, of course, but my plan if I were to become pregnant is to practice as normal unless/until I was truly incapable of carrying on that way."

Stay here until you feel comfortable balancing for an extended period of time before moving your foot up your leg/thigh. \n\n* When I do tree pose, I keep my hands in prayer position with my elbows raised up so they are aligned with my wrists and my forearms are parallel to the floor. Arms like this: https://www.dreamstime.com/stock-photo-young-asian-woman-prayer-position-yoga-young-asian-woman-prayer-position-yoga-copy-space-happiness-smiling-image99480468\nWhile my arms are in that position, I SQUEEZE my hands together. The compression seems to help with balance.\n\n* You know how you are now squeezing your hands together? Do the SAME thing with your raised foot that is up on your leg. Think about squeezing/pushing your foot into your leg and pushing your leg into your foot. By doing this, your leg muscles will engage and help you to find that stability.\n\n* I personally like the verbal cue to \"root your standing foot into the ground\". Imagine your standing foot/leg have roots into your mat. Don't forget to maintain a slight bend in your standing knee. It also helps to spread your toes wide on your mat.\n\n* Are you engaging your core? DON'T FORGET to engage your core! This is pretty much the foundation of any balance pose. You have to engage your core!\n\n* It can be very helpful to gaze at a fixed point.\n\n* Grow tall in your standing leg! It *is* called \"Tree Pose\" after all."

When the student has done this and has been okayed to attend class, then perhaps you can offer modifications. \n\nIt is true that often times flexion of the spine and twisting are aggravating for discs, however every injury is unique. Sometimes it is lateral bending or extension of the spine. Even stretching the hips or hamstrings may be too much for some. \n\nFor things like this, it really is best if the student speaks with a specialist. As a commenter mentioned above, sometimes yoga is not the answer for a bulging disc and it should be avoided altogether. \n\nHope this helps!"

You're wheel pose might of been in perfect alignment but he could of seen that you needed to get out of your mind and focus more on your body. Wheel pose encourages arching and so the fingers moving up your body corresponds with the pose.\n\nI can't claim to know what you have gone through. Doing a heart opening pose brings up a lot of emotional stuff. Maybe you could use this as a learning experience? Allowing yourself to attend but being cautious, draw your lines, and focus on the reason you started going to classes in the first place.\n\nOr hey find a teacher you feel comfortable with and not deal with the situation at all.   \n\nI have a rhetorical questions for you. Why did you pick this class, does the studio not have any other classes available? \n\nOne thing I know for sure, not all men are the same just like all of us women aren't the same.

This is especially true if you’re a beginner, plan on practicing regularly, or have any kind of pre existing injury. The teacher in the yoga video isn’t going to be able to assess your alignment or show you anything beyond the most basic modifications. Having poor form when doing the same poses over and over (sun salutes anyone?) is a recipe for an injury. I cannot even tell you how many students I have that practice on their own and can do headstands all day long but fall apart in down dog. \n\nThere’s also the fact that, like any other fitness activity, it can be motivating to practice with other people and can help hold you accountable to having a consistent practice. The same way that someone will run regularly with a friend but hasn’t used their home treadmill since they bought it. The act of setting aside time in my day to go to the studio and practice makes me more likely to challenge myself, to learn, and to want to be present and focused.\n\nIt’s interesting- I’m active on a bunch of fitness subs as well and there’s just not the pushback against having a professional show you what to do that there is on this particular sub. Maybe because it’s “just yoga” and people don’t take teachers as seriously? I don’t know. We get so many people on this sub asking extremely specific questions about creating a yoga sequence and get irritated that the teachers here won’t create that for them for free (yes, this is my major pet peeve). Or they have extremely specific health concerns and will just shut down any discussion of going to an actual yoga class. Then we get (possibly the same) people with yoga related injuries who want to know what went wrong but- you guessed it! still refuse to go to an actual class. Not saying that’s you at all, but certainly worth noting."

The active engagement should help with shoulder pain/fatigue/ache. You can maybe help yourself more by recruiting the muscles in your back to help strongly stay in the pose - I usually say something like “put your mind in the muscle” to students in my class when we have long holds or if there’s a certain muscle we are trying to get to in an unconventional (at least for yoga) way. I hope this helps!\n\nEta: if you bend your knees and/or take a wider stance with your DD, you may find some relief — if all else fails, rest and take tabletop instead of DD for a while. I have several people who have shoulder problems and leave DD out of their practice - do what feels the best to you!\n\nEta2: you can use blocks against the backs of your forearms so your elbows don’t hyperextend, if maybe they are doing that and causing some disengagement in your upper body. \n\n��I’m long winded today!

I practiced about 3-5 times a week and then eventually I started doing other exercises too and would do yoga 2 or 3 times a week. It made me highly aware of my body and what I was putting in it. I ended up losing about 35 pounds. I also felt more happy, in general because I felt in control of my life (and at peace with the things I knew I couldn't control). \n\nHowever, over the last couple years I've had a lot of changes in my life and have fallen out of a routine. I've gained a bit of the weight back, probably about 10 - 15 lbs (although I'm avoiding a scale because I don't want to confirm), but I feel like once I get back on track I'll be able to lose it. I'm working on getting back into it and ended up doing an hour of practice yesterday. It wasn't too intense, but I still felt so stiff and a bit disappointed that I am not longer as flexblible as I used to be. My shoulders are pretty sore today too.\n\nBasically, I'm just trying to say that it won't be easy for us, but I also feel happier and healthier already since I made the time yesterday. And I'm sure we will start feeling more flexible and stronger again before we know it!\n\nNameste ����"

Typically the same is true for restorative, but you’re using props (bolsters, blocks, straps, blankets) so that you can completely relax and allow gravity to do the work. In yin there can still be some muscular engagement. \n\nIn other types of yoga you may not hold the poses long at all, but that kind of yoga isn’t for stretching or getting into the fascia. It’s the strengthening, balance, more aerobic type of yoga. (Ashtanga, Vinyasa, Hatha, Power, 26+2...)"

You don't need to push yourself harder than you want to. No pressure. Literally.\n\n2. I often go to a yoga class when I'm recovering from injury (I had more than my share of those). Before class, I like to mention to the instructor that I'm out of shape and/or nursing a sore [fill in the blank], etc. they always reassure me that I can take it easy and ask if I'd like them to offer adjustments to make things a little easier for me, considering the specific limitation I'm dealing with at that time. By having this brief conversation, I feel  I have a personal ally in the classroom and it makes me feel more self-assured when I bail out of a pose that is too challenging for me that day!\n\nHave fun :)"

I think they have a basis here. When you have white people who are so proud of the Sanskrit they learned but they can't (and often don't even try) to pronounce your Sanskrit name, there seems to be something missing. And maybe Indians don't have the deep spirituality that they did thousands of years ago, but habits and cultural practices remain. And there are white people who relish in the novelty of such practices but don't at all acknowledge that these novelties are just regular life for people of an Indian background.\n\nYes, the deeper practice of yoga is above culture, race, and background. But as long as these yoga studios want to incorporate said culture and background into their classes, then do it with some understanding of where it comes from."

My assumption is they want you do avoid crunching, twisting, planking; really active engagements. \n\nEven sitting requires support from your core on some level. It’s not the most intense engagement in the world but any time your spine is being supported your core is being used.\n\nYou could probably do stuff like sleeping pigeon with a bolster supporting your chest. Supported fish pose with a really small blanket roll, to focus on opening in your collarbones and throat. \n\nIf you’re allowed to walk, I’d recommend just walking a whole lot.

I genuinely always appreciate it when people help point out if I'm doing something wrong, or if my alignment is iffy, or give me a nudge towards how I should be doing it.\n\nThe way I've always seen it is that I should treat myself the same way I'd treat others. I HAVE seen people use the wrong alignment or maybe not entirely getting a pose, or at an earlier progression compared to where I'm at. Lots of times!

    "body": "In every yoga pose, there is a structural alignment and a balancing action. The structural alignment is what happens with your bones when you do nothing (passive stretching) and the balancing action is the opposite anatomical action (active stretching). Active stretching means to guide your bones in the correct direction to activate your muscles while you lengthen them. \n\nIn your case this would mean pulling the knees towards each other (Adduction) but also pulling the pubic bone towards the sternum (very slight posterior Pelvic tilt) to give the adductors the right position to work properly.\n\nIf you find this hard to understand think of a plank. If you do nothing and just hang in the joints, the scapulae will be retracted (shoulder blades move towards each other) and you probably feel compression in front at the point where the armbone and shoulder blade connect while at the same time the scapulae elevate (shoulderblades towards ears). The proper balancing actions are Protraction (shoulder blades spread away from each other) depression (shoulderblades down) and external rotation of the humerus (upper arm rotating out, aiding in keeping the shoulder blades down.)\n\nEvery yoga pose has a unique way of organizing your skeleton and even the easiest poses are quite complex. It is always best to find a teacher that's properly schooled in anatomy. It is almost impossible to understand the anatomical complexities of the postures on your own."

Some people are inconsiderate by nature, but we choose how we allow ourselves to be treated. \n\n I'd imagine you felt \"super rude and fussy\" because you resented him for not catching your subliminal angry vibes and, below the surface, you were angry with yourself for not being able to just say something. It's very common for people pleasers (myself included) to become irrationally angry when other people invade our boundaries because we have a really hard time being assertive. IMO, if someone steps on your mat, it's reasonable to be annoyed at their lack of consideration. If someone steps on your mat over and over and you don't say anything, then the only person you should be angry with is yourself because *you* allowed the behavior to continue.  \n\nI don't mean that to sound harsh! These are just some tough lessons that I've been grappling with lately that seemed applicable here.

It is bad form because of the hip and shoulder height. It is more efficient to simply straighten the arms from true chatturanga (shoulders are the same height as the elbows) and drop the hips. When the move is mastered, it is fluid and graceful. I believe the reason why many do the glide is that they are not yet strong enough to hold a true chatturanga and they believe that the glide is a fluid transition."

Last month I confirmed what I’ve suspected for a while: my right leg is significantly out of alignment with my left. It seems to be pulled almost a full inch up higher, along with my right hip . Yesterday the instructor told us to stand on our toes during downward facing dog and I could see my left toes were doing fine, seemed well extended, etc. My right toes were largely folded, like a fan, with my big toe doing most of the work. I want to fix the misalignment since it’s obviously messing with other parts of my body besides just my hip/leg. You can see in this picture as well, left toes are well extended and have hardly any joint creasing (idk what’s the appropriate vernacular here),  but the right look scrunched up and struggling. I’m also noticing that in a lot of poses, my right toes don’t even meet the floor, but seem to hover just above it.\n\nI’m sick of nearly falling over in one legged poses or struggling with poses that require balance (you know...most of them lol). I wonder if anyone has tips for correcting alignment at home? After a lifetime of being clumsy, I’m thinking this has been a key factor and I’d love some help.\n\nEdit: to those suggesting physical therapy, I agree with you. But I’m currently saving to buy a house and yoga classes are my largest superfluous expense. I’ve done physical therapy quite a bit in my past and simply can’t afford it at the moment. When my budget is more flexible I’ll be sure to do so. In the meantime, I’m trying to do what I can to relieve the situation at home. Also edited some for clarity’s sake."

The first step to deepening that pose would be to draw knee over ankle, creating a 90 angle where shin/knee/thigh meet, and to make sure you're squaring your hips towards the front of the mat. That allows the hips to drop/move and the stretch to deepen in the hip flexors. \n\nTry it, honestly. I just got on my mat and went into crescent as he did with my knee set back from my ankle. As soon as you move the hips forward to align the knee over ankle you can feel the stretch more, especially in the psoas. \n\nThe guy isn't wrong about the length of the stance affecting the stretch, but it seems odd to worry about the length before focusing on that alignment point and potentially destabilizing the pose."

Face counter probably minimum 6 inches away, lean forward, pressing your heels into the ground, stretch the muscles from the heels of your feet up your calves. Calf muscles are usually under-active from sitting too long as well\n\nThis is my experience in learning to condition my body.

A good teacher might pull you aside after class and inquire as to what is making you uncomfortabe with the chanting. They could also provide some information about the benefits they see in in chanting/why they include it in the class. But then (and MOST IMPORTANT) honor your capacity to make decisions for yourself.

I’m an empath and highly sensitive person, so I have a bad habit of absorbing emotions and moods and blah blah. I’m working on balance! I try to do something productive when I’m criticized to, I don’t know, convert that negative energy. If someone is just having a bad day and being a butt, eh, I still had a chance to be introspective and seek ways to improve the way I treat people, present love, etc.  If the person was totally right for criticizing me, welp—looks like a hard truth I needed to learn ��\n\n^^you didn’t ask for this essay, ha!

    "body": "Be compassionate where you are, be patient, and keep practicing.\n\nHolding a yoga pose is more than just strength, it's also coordination. Depending on the holding patterns of your body, you may not have an efficient activation of the muscle chain connecting between your core and the tips of your fingers. Your breath is your teacher for figuring out where you may be holding on where you don't need to. Ultimately you want to breathe with your whole body so that your breath can reach every cell of your body. That includes your pinky toes. Using mindfulness of breath we expand our awareness to encompass our entire body. While maintaining that awareness we use our intention and attention to move our body closer to our goal.\n\nSo my first suggestion is to breeeeeathe... Put weight into your hands and fingers and just let the breath drip down your arms into the ground. Let go of everything so you can feel your muscles relax and the weight sinks more and more into your hands without collapsing your alignment and structure. You can do this in any Asana where you feel you can be most mindful and connect to your body. I start in table, personally.\n\nMy second suggestion is PLAY. Experiment moving your body around the foundation of your fingers, hands, and arms. Use your breath to make sure you're connected to your core. Play with your alignment to see where you can achieve your most delightful and easy breaths. I personally use a lot of rocking and movement and micro adjustments, paying attention to letting my breath drop more into my belly and be more at ease. When I do all this movement I'm basically trying to trace out my edge. Once you find the unique shape of your edge you can start playing with it. Again, using your breath, to EXPAND. I never think stretching, I always think EXPANSION. Strength comes from the stability, and flexibility comes from the expansion. Always try to hold when you feel most at ease and expansive. Asana means steady and easy.\n\nUltimately, you're trying to reach stillness. It may require a lot of movement to loosen up the stories and holding patterns of the mind and body, but you should be moving towards ease and peace. Perfection is achieved not when there's nothing more to add, but when there's nothing left to remove.\n\nBest wishes"

    "body": "These are just some generic items you can try, not sure where you're practice is at;\n\n\\- handstand kick up (beware of the 'banana back', try and stay as hollow as possible. This can be achieved best with your finger tips closest to the wall. As you progress you can move one foot away from the wall and then the other, speeding up the process until you can comfortably move both legs off the wall. \n\n\\-Handstand wall walk up's, sit in an L sit with your back up against the wall and legs out straight, make note of where your leg length ends (as this is where your hands will go next). Place the hands where the end of the legs were and start to walk the feet up the wall, the higher your feet go the more difficult this will become. Once your body position is at 90 degrees, your hips should be stacked on top of your shoulders and the shoulders over the wrist. From here begin to lift one leg at a time to start to work your stability and  'lift'. \n\n\\*Pro tip: make sure you spend at least 20 minutes warming up your wrist and forearms. Frequently our handstands don't work because our hands, wrist and fingers aren't warm enough yet, taking 20 minutes to focus on this before every practice will make the world of a difference. \n\nGood luck!"

    "body": "&gt; What do you wish you knew before doing your 500 hr?\n\nThis is probably going to sound... off/blunt/shitty, but I'm going to say it anyway. Having done multiple trainings, they're just... training. You've trained, you're experienced, and you've been teaching. There's nothing more to know about the 500hr, really - it's just more training, *hopefully* of a level of quality that it builds on your existing base. People that are not ready need this question, only rephrased to 'In what ways am I not yet ready for my 500hr?' From a purely practical standpoint, you have the bases covered. You're one of the good guys, based on what we see around here. \n\nThat being said... it took me a long time to find someone I'd consider doing my 500hr with, and my 500hr was chosen purely for me. Having been practicing for 20ish years at that point, the notion of doing a 500hr with someone only practicing for a fraction of that time seemed far beyond pointless. I wanted something with a focus on more than just asana and found it, with a teacher whose actual practice went far beyond asana to the full, true study of all 8 limbs and someone who had been teaching for even longer than I had been practicing, and practicing for twice as long as I. \n\nHad I settled for what seems to be the 'industry standard', I'd have wished I'd known that, I guess. But having taken more than one training as well as a lot of workshops over the years and noting from whom I learned the most, it was really obvious that a newly minted 500hr teacher would not have been the right choice (which is really just common sense). \n\nSome things to consider (none of it's probably new to you at this stage of the game, though): \n\n- Why do you want to do the training? \n- Will doing so satisfy that why?\n- Do you know what your gaps are? \n- Will this training help address those gaps, or is there a better way?\n- Does the teacher in question have something of value **to you** that will be imparted in this training? \n- Is this a case of 'it's time to learn more' and maybe your 500hr isn't the right more?\n- Is this a case of 'it's time to do my 500hr' and this isn't the right one? \n- What do YOU need right now? \n- What do your students need right now? \n- Is this training for you, for them, or both?"

This increased circulation makes it easier to use your muscles. This increased circulation translates to an increased demand for oxygen, which is why your respiration also picks up when exercising in the heat. \n\nBoth internal and external heat trigger this in the body."

Also, in Warrior I and II, I prefer to position my feet \"on railroad tracks,\" as a popular cue goes, which helps to accommodate the width of my hips and gives me a more stable base.

My mat, since I sweat a ton too, I have a normal practice mat, and I'm looking for a specific hot yoga mat (haven't found one yet... but I've been loving these suggestions)\n2. INVEST IN A MAT TOWEL. they fit perfectly on your mat and it helps with grip. \nPro tip: when youre setting up, pour some water on the towel on the top and bottom of your mat. It keeps the towel  secure.\n3. Dont wear shorts.... shorts sound amazing, but if you do any type of arm connecting to the legs (crow, twists, or even holding onto your feet like dancer) it's very slippery... not saying it can't be done, but the grip from fabric helps.\n4. I see above that some people prefer not to eat before / hydrate during practice and i respect their choices and I'm happy they know what works for their body. For me personally, I need a small something in my stomach before or after or I get very lightheaded (especially if it's a high intensity vinyasa class) so even just a small protein drink an hour before hand really helps my body stay strong throughout. With water, I love having super cold ice water in my insulated bottle. This is heaven in the middle of a flow after I drenched a liter of sweat onto my mat, I also love to drink right before savasana to help my body start to cool down.\n5. Have fun, and dont worry!!!

Like, the concept of recovery runs, recovery weeks, deloading and giving yourself a break - all of that applies to your mental state as well as your physical state. \n\nSo if I were to find myself in a similar situation like you, or unable to hold a pose that normally is straightforward, I just take it as a sign that today is meant for something different, or that it'd be better for me to practice something else. It doesn't mean I can't do the pose, or I'm not able to achieve it; just not *right then*. And that's fine too! I might move onto the next workout, split things over two days instead of one, just attempt one of the other goals I have in mind (e.g. if handstands are just not happening, then I'll work on holding  crow for a little longer than I did last time, or shift to stretching splits a little deeper). \n\nLike, I always prefer to just... instead of trying to force yourself to do something that isn't working, find out what it is or where you can go instead. Breathing and focus should be the foundation of what you're doing with yoga, so if focusing on breathing while doing tricky poses isn't right, then maybe you could try asking yourself which poses you can shift to doing instead that would give you the mental space to focus on your breathing."

The body benefits are simply too numerous to get into, but psychologically speaking learning to breathe and be patient, to look for truth and understanding for yourself, to find balance without AND within...  Just a few of the overall benefits to your life.  You will change, and it will inspire you to be the best version of yourself, through which everyone benefits.  And, bring as physically healthy as this practice makes you is undeniable.  When I got out of the army, the PTSD gave me nightmares every night almost.  The fracture on my vertabrae didn't help much either.  Now my limp is gone, my back pain is a distant memory, and I haven't had any nightmares in at least a year and a half.

    "body": "Tuck drills and roll drills. I was at a party and one girl happened to be a yoga teacher and told me this. Basically a tuck drills, you are preparing to go into a handstand but 5-12 inches from the wall. Jump up but tuck the knees into the chest. Your aim is to get your butt on the wall. You will tip past your balance point, which will get rid of the fear of tipping past and to be familiar with where is too far back. You also pass through a perfect balance on the way there.\n\n\nFor roll drills, be outside on grass, with your mat. Kick up into a handstand, tuck your chin, and practice rolling out of it. Several times. Like a somersault. Keep it it until it is your instinct. \n\nTrust that your body will protect you instinctively. You technically can bite your fingers off but your body won't let you. You have mechanisms built in to keep you safe, you were not born with the abilities you have now, you worked for them. It is obvious that you are strong enough to balance without the wall, because you just did it. Remind yourself of this.\n\nIf you have alo moves I highly recommend the series freedom from fear. It is an inversion series but as opposed to focusing on techniques or ideas, the whole approach is to get over the fear of falling and hurting yourself, and accepting when you do fall without hurting yourself."

    "body": "I think focusing less on the height of your legs in any asana where your feet are off the ground can be helpful. Many dance techniques encourage turnout because it allows for greater range of motion in the hip. In yoga, that height just isn't important in most asanas. I would focus on working with your legs as low as necessary until you build more strength to keep your legs in parallel.\n\nAlso worth noting: Some dancers assume that external rotation is the only type of rotation that requires strength, but working in parallel or internal rotation also requires strength, just of different muscles. It's possible that after years of dance training, some of these rotators responsible for internal rotation aren't nearly as strong as the ones responsible for external rotation. You may need to work on exercises to strengthen these."

I think you should try and get in touch with the teacher to ask.  I'm guessing you'll discover it was something other than simply sitting in sukhasana.  It's still possible, and perhaps likely, the teacher overreacted, but you can't know for sure until you find out exactly *what* they were reacting to."

For me, yoga is great, and I try to basically see my non-yoga workouts as building strength and flexibility levels towards achieving particular yoga poses or personal skill goals. \n\nWhat I do now is a combination of core-focused yoga that centers around prepping for inversions (need that core strength to hold those poses), and skill-based bodywork workouts to support and supplement that. I've been using a slightly modified version of /u/Antranik's excellent (and free!) [bodyweight training](https://antranik.org/bodyweight-training/) program for the last six weeks and have seen pretty amazing improvement, and I find that his focus on both strength and skill work isn't just engaging, but also gives me a much better foundation for improving my yoga practice. Plus all the progressions make it a lot more fun than just pure strength work alone. I hope to move on to his rings programme in future, maybe after another couple of months when I have a higher base level of ability. \n\nBasically, find what works for you - if yoga is your goal, then find strength workouts that push you to be better at it, rather than forcing yourself to focus on something you don't like."

    "body": "The immersion is done with a rotating roster of different instructors. Kim Puryear is introductory stuff, yin, meditation, Michael Johnson is Sanskrit, deep philosophy/history stuff,  and so on. You might be particularly interested in Sierra Hollister who does Kundalini and also works with Light a Path, an organization for underserved yoga, you can look up those names for more info. You'll get a sampling of all sorts of styles from restorative to Ashtanga, and there's some discussion of the readings, particularly the Gita and the Sutras, Ayurveda is covered, etc. \n\nFor meeting you where you are: Mentally, they emphasize that you should let the deluge of info run over you and what you need will stick with you, so no one is left behind, but obviously you'll get more out of it if you read and comprehend the background material before hand and have a good basis beforehand. Physically, of course you're allowed to tap out/rest, but there are extended sequences where you're learning the finer points of poses, and you're being adjusted by your fellow trainees, and if you can't manage the pose it's kind of a wasted lesson for you unless you're really good at understanding anatomy stuff without actually physically doing it (I'm not.) So, like either you can handstand against a wall or you're cool with simply watching/learning about it, there's no opportunity to do a different inversion at that time.\n\nTeaching me to teach, yes and no. I learned a ton, we practiced cuing  a ton, and I felt on top of the world and it wasn't until I got my first job (beginner vinyasa at a gym) and wondered what the heck is with these people, that I realized I'd basically learned to teach yoga to people who are already very good at / interested in yoga, and teaching to people with no body awareness/yoga experience or who are unfit is a whole other thing. \n\nI stayed at the Namastay house (which I think was about $500 for my immersion). It's about an easy mile walk from the program building, nice little place, yoga space, full kitchen, and it was fun being with other AYCers all the time, it felt like being in a college dorm again.  I will mention that most of us were all early-20s except for one older person and most people in our program were youngish with a handful-ish of older (40+) people, and social lines kinda developed where they would decline checking out the city/bars/nightlife/etc and so no one really got to know them super well because we never saw them socially. There were no hard feelings (someone even made a joke out of it, \"I'm too old to go out past 11\") and  I'm not trying to imply that you wouldn't be into going out or anything, I just wanted to mention the social dynamics that developed in my training and so that if you wanted to be tight knit with your fellow students you could stay at the house and be involved socially and expect that you'll probably be the oldest person in the house if you stay there (I can't speak for every round of training just mine and two others via friends who also did AYC).  I know most other yogis stayed at airBnBs. I would strongly recommend a short commute as you have fairly long days plus get free classes at AYC and you have to take 10 classes outside of the training.\n\nThat's a massive ramble, but I hope this was helpful.

I honestly wasn't a very good ballet student and don't remember why but I THINK the idea was: say you have a straight line of tape connecting your right hip point to your left hip point but when you're in mountain pose the line of tape is not parallel to the floor - \"ah ha! One of my hips is higher than the other! Am I really placing your weight evenly? Do I have a structural imbalance? Interesting, my 'high' hip is the one opposite the shoulder I usually have my heavy purse on maybe I should address that...\"\n\nI don't have a mirror near where I practice at home so I've never tried it but it might be interesting to see if you marked, say, your femurs, because you want to focus on externally rotating your legs in downward dog or something. Next time you looked in the mirror your eye would be drawn to the tape first, both because it is literally a visual focal point, but also because mentally you have established you're using the mirror as a tool."

Also important to note, deeper does not always mean better for a pose. You want to go to your depth and stay true to your body's natural alignment, otherwise you might not be getting the most out of your practice or could be injuring yourself. When in doubt, always come back to your breath and listen to your body. \n\nOne pose that can look especially different on everyone is downward facing dog. But for this, and all poses, there are modifications we can take to get the most out of our practice. For downward dog, we focus melting the heart and lengthening the spine, pressing palms down. Having straight legs and pressing heels to the mat will come with time and forcing them can throw the rest of your body out of alignment.

    "body": "sure. just throwing a guess out there, and so you understand better where I'm going with this, if you are reaching down to the floor from standing and don't quite have the hamstring length yet, you'll compensate by bending your knees a bit so you can reach the floor first instead of crashing down onto your hands, so maybe when you come down to downdog, you end up with bent knees and your hips (and therefore center of gravity) closer to your feet. meanwhile, from plank or updog, your knees are already straight and your hands and feet are already planted, so assuming hamstring tightness, there's less of a tendency to compensate by bending the knees in downdog"
