Like tonight I was doing a restorative practice and I *slowly* went into a reclined cobblers pose, and my back cramped to the point I had to put pillows under my hips and roll onto my side.

I have lots of upper body strength, so I can fully experience and enjoy poses that rely on that aspect of me.  Tree pose on my right leg?  I could fight off at least 3 toy poodles and maintain it.  I could take over a small country on my right leg.  On my left leg I become the leaning tower of Pisa. If someone gently coughs, the slight gust of air blows me over like a feather.  I become as unsteady and shaky as an 8th grader trying to get to second base, even when using my right foot as a kick stand.\n\nMy enlightened teachers say things like, “that’s where the yoga begins” and “yoga isn’t about ego.”  I used to spiritually appreciate the tasty karmic humble pie that left-legged tree pose serves up.  I even go stand by the wall when this nemesis pose comes up to symbolically declare to the universe and my fellow yogis that I suck at left-side tree pose.  I get the sun/moon, yin/yang, male/female thing.  But I’m a Libra and I need symmetry!  I even practice in my kitchen or in line at the store.  That being said, after 9 months of little progress, I surrender!  I think I’m doing all of the fundamentals correctly.  What else can I do?"

I don't really notice it anytime except when I'm laying in sulpine, and am doing any form of foward bend/spinal flection. There seems to be an spinal extrusion right in the center of the rounded part of my spine that extrudes further and presses painfully into the ground when I do the flection. \n\nSome poses that it's obvious are\nPavanamuktasana (Wind Relieving Pose) and happy baby.\nI first noticed I was different when the yoga instructor told us to \"curl into a ball, and roll back and forth, massaging your back.\" It is painful for me to do this as the extrusion gets pressed into the hard floor, while everyone else seemed to have no problems.\n\nAs far as I know it's been like that all my life. It's not really noticable anytime except when I do sulpine poses... I'm wondering if anyone knows what it is and if I should get it looked at"

I just try to notice whatever is in my body that is the most easy to put my attention on. I have been doing this for quite some time now and it has become a lot easier with practice. :)"

If I know what words mean I kinda try to channel that internally (if that makes sense) but otherwise I just don’t feel comfortable repeating phrases when I don’t know what they mean. I’m not deep into the spiritual side of yoga, although I do love the focus on non judgment, honesty, acceptance, etc because I am a very anxious person. I’m very subtle about it and I do always bow my head and thank the teacher after class.\n\n2) Ladies wearing only sports bras on top. I don’t do heated classes but I sweat a ton. Normally I wouldn’t think twice but my studio clientele leans more toward middle aged women and nobody even shows midriff usually. Is it weird??"

In prenatal classes instructors often seamlessly make those modifications to poses so I'm not always aware that something is different for a specific reason. So I'm looking to learn more about specific things I MUST adjust when practicing on my own.\n\nBeyond issues of some things being not feasible or not comfortable (e.g. not lying on your back or needing a wider stance folds), are there certain movements or poses that are considered DANGEROUS in pregnancy? Or is it feasible to continue your regular practice and adjust by listening closely and seeing what feels right? \n\nThanks so much in advance for your advice and input!"

And actively press into your forearms to get your shoulders away from your ears.  I’m not there yet either!  But your headstand looks really good."

Active.\n\nI have a very tight lower back that causes me agro when I'm bending over to pick something up, moving positions whilst sat down and sometimes even walking. It's super tight to the point where standing back up straight had to be done slowly and smoothly, it's not severe pain like breaking a bone it's more of an uncomfortable radiating stiffness that just slows my manoeuvrability.\n\nIt started around 4 months ago after I was surfing and the pain came and went and only really returned when I surfed. I then decided to take up yoga as a remedy and the results are amazing, I have no back pain what so ever.\n\nHowever the new problem rises when I take a few days off the pain seems to return and comes on even tronger. Is this common? It's like my body is addicted to the yoga.\n\nI attend at least 3 times per week on average but often attend 4 Mon - Thu. Weekends I'm out surfing. \n\nNow I don't plan to attend this much forever as I have other hobbies to work at, yoga was just a short term whim really that I would like to drop down to once per week, although now i'm not sure if that will be enough.\n\nWhat are your opinions on the matter?\n\nThanks for any info on advance.\n\nUpdate: Attended a sports PT and he told me nothing serious is going on but the prolonged surf sessions has agitated a lower disk and my muscles are cramping up to protect it. \n\nAdvised me to follow a few lower back strengthening exercises per day and maintain good posture. It should at least start clear up in the next couple of weeks. \n\nMobility is my friend and that Yoga should be continued at least twice a week.\n\nGood feedback really.\n\nThanks."

I had been following a yoga instructor for a while on Instagram who worked there and was encouraged when my work took me there one day. The Universe was clearly trying to tell me something. \n\nSo I was there, yoga-ing with some incredibly physically beautiful people and normal type people. As I looked closer, respectfully, I realized I could see all the flaws, “wobbly bits”, some incredible tattoo inking, and folds of skin. I saw my reflection and was disgusted with the “chunky monkey” looking back at me. \n\nBut here’s the kicker....\n\nI realized that I’m a beautiful person too!! Sure I’m a little overweight, stressed out at times dealing with my Nex-SO, but by being true to myself  it makes me a beautiful person who has a right to be with positive people. \n\nSo to all of you who are going through these tough times, stay beautiful!!\n\n\n...and do yoga!"

Now this was just a coincidence, but as I was in down dog, my sinuses momentarily cleared from the heat/humidity plus my head being upside down. Right then, the instructor went through the toxin spiel, and I was totally into it like. \"Yeah! Alright!

Is it safe to continue with handstand practice or pull-up movements?\n\nI will go easy on wrist heavy asanas this week. I’m currently taking teacher trainer daily, so it’s not possible to just totally stop and rest. Thank you !"

Which assists make you feel amazing? Are there any that you feel uncomfortable with? All experiences and opinions are welcome. \n\nOf course I’m looking at safety of the pose first. So checking for proper alignment and then diving a little deeper into the pose if the student wants to."

After having to take a 2 week break from golf because of a bad back I'm looking to get back into it but with better flexibility. I'm currently 2 days into a 30 day challenge by yoga with Adrienne but would like to get some in class training too. A studio close to my house offers a beginners drop in on sundays, some fundamental classes, and a all levels class every day (fits my schedule best). Will I feel out of place or be left in the dust during the All Levels? Is the 30 day challenge enough? Am I over thinking all of this? Any of your thoughts would be appreciated."

I’m 21 years old and not terribly unfit but have dreadful posture and am the least flexible person I know. When I do child’s pose it hurts my inner thighs. When I try downwards dog I can’t get my feet down from my tip toes and although I’ve seen people say to bend your legs and keep your back straight I physically can’t - just trying hurts my lower back and shoulders. My wrists hurt when I put any pressure on them.  Etc. Almost every part of my body hurts too much to continue whenever I try. I’m not aware of any injuries or health issues - I’m just that inflexible. \n\nI had hoped yoga would make me more flexible, but the pain caused by being inflexible makes it extremely difficult and unpleasant to try for long enough to see any results. I’m at a loss. Any ideas?"

The sequence started with an extended child's pose like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqVMAPM00DM) where you use your fingertips to reach out and stretch your back with your head down, then it transitions into an upward facing dog or a cobra. Not sure which one it is but the transition occurred after you try to reach out with your hands as far as possible during the extended child's pose, to stretch your back. The transition to the upward dog or cobra keeps your nose at the same distance from the ground. It's like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HerlEPvo5es) but the other way around starting from child's pose then to cobra, and keeping your nose to the ground as you move your head forward and into the cobra or upward dog."

A few hours after practice, I get a twinge whenever i fully extend or contract my arm.\n\nCan anyone help with either tips to reduce the strain on that joint during the pose, or with advice to strengthen it?"

I've been doing lots of physical therapy, posture and back exercises, pec stretching and rotator cuff work. So any poses that include that stuff is great. Prior to this injury I was doing yoga regularly, and I really want to get back into a practice but have trouble accepting this new \"normal\"....but hopefully not normal forever. I lose the arterial bloodflow when I raise my left arm above my head. My right arm is fine and my strength on both sides is pretty good. Does anyone have any resources or modified pose ideas they can share? For instance, I can do warrior one, but I keep my left hand on my hip and extend my right arm up. Thanks guys! I think the biggest thing is just not getting discouraged with this and lots of trial and error."

First off I know that the recommended route is joining a class but it's not an option for me for personal reasons I'd rather not go into right now :)\n\nThat said, I'm looking to find some yoga sequences/styles that I can practice which carry the least inherent risk of injury to my back. I've read a couple of books by Dr Stuart McGill who is an expert on back injury and is of the opinion that back flexion/extension under load wears out your spin over time and makes you more at risk of back injuries, and in general everything he advocates involves keeping a neutral spine.\n\nI've started following this advice in my non-yoga exercise routine (mainly strength training). So when I watch myself in the mirror trying to do some common yoga poses like forward folds I wince a bit because I can see how my back rounds despite my best efforts. Another thing I wince at is the process of rising up from a downward dog in the Sun Salutation A (where you bring your feet forward and then stand up straight, my spine is never neutral here).\n\nMaybe it's because my hamstrings aren't flexible enough yet and I guess that will come with time and more practice. But until that point what kind of sequences/videos would you recommend that don't involve 'risky' poses like the forward fold where it's tougher to keep your spine neutral?"

I am a highly anxious, frequently stressed out person. When I am taking a yoga class, the last thing I want to think about is my to-do list, or my job, or everything that needs to get done at home, etc...\n\nFor me, this means that all of my focus is on each pose and nothing else. Fast-pace classes are great for me opposed to classes where there are a lot of static poses, because I don't like time to think and let all of those stress-filled thoughts enter my head again. At the same time, I like the opportunity to explore my full-range of motion so I personally love it when instructors cue 2-3 rounds of a pose (e.g., 2 rounds of bridge before going into wheel). \n\nWhile I enjoy fast paced classes, that also doesn't mean I want to hurry through a pose with bad form. I appreciate instructors who cue flows, while also respecting that I might take my time to go through each pose. I suppose a good example of this would be flowing through plank --&gt; chataranga--&gt; up-dog --&gt; down-dog. I like it when instructors tell me to \"go through your flow\" and then \"meet in down-dog\" so that I can flow through my chataranga in my own time and pause longer in down-dog.\n\nI really enjoy classes with instructors who guide their students through modifications and offer corrections (either verbal or hands-on) as those verbal reminders are really important for safety (I always forget to engage my core)! Aside from that, I'm not picky about music during the class, but I especially enjoy nature sounds (i.e., waves crashing, birds singing) for savasana.\n\nInstructors who are open to questions and discussion after class are worth their weight in gold. I also appreciate instructors who might pause class before a sequence to remind students proper form and demonstrate that proper form."

      "reddit": "I'm a new yoga teacher who just started teaching 3 morning classes/week at a gym. So far I love it...there is a large group of dedicated students that make it to every single class of mine, and so far it's gone really well. I learn something new every single class and look forward to gaining more experience as time goes on.\n\nHowever, there's this one student in particular who seems to find issue with almost everything--I was actually given a heads up about this student before I ever met them, as they are \"known\" at the gym for their constant complaints. I was advised by my boss to not take any of it personally or too seriously, because that's just how this person is.\n\nWell, right away I knew who this student was because sure enough, I had a flood of commentary from them at the end of the class--however, this student has now told me on multiple occasions that they really enjoy my class, so that made me feel amazing! If the notorious complainer likes my classes, that's an accomplishment, right?\n\nAnyway, after class the other day, this student approached me to complain about how obnoxious they find the other students...most of the class has attended yoga together for over a decade, so the minutes before class are often spent chatting. According to this student, it comes across as \"bar room banter,\" obnoxious, and far too loud for yoga. While I personally don't find the other students too loud, and know that this particular student is very opinionated, I also want EVERYONE to feel welcome in my class. So this morning, I made an attempt to quiet things down before class started by suggesting that everyone get into a comfortable position on their backs in preparation for centering. This helped a little, but not everyone quit chatting and the student who complained to me spent several minutes literally shushing everyone in the room. So I wasn't surprised when, after the class, they complained again about other students talking before class. The student said they love my class, the pacing and flow, etc...they actually said it's PERFECT for them, but that the other students \"totally ruin it.\" They did mention that they noticed how I got the class into a supine posture before class started, but basically implied that wasn't enough. They then went on to kinda sorta lecture me about how control of the class is part of teaching, that they're a teacher too (a school teacher, not a yoga teacher..prob important to make that distinction!), and that what I should specifically do is tell them to \"pipe down\" (exact phrasing here) and/or make them do a breathing exercise before class starts, specifically one \"where their tongue is on the roof of their mouth so they are physically unable to speak.\"\n\nMy friends, I was kind of flabbergasted at this point. So here is my thing. I realize that this student is a bit...special. It doesn't help that I personally don't find the noise levels to be unreasonable before class, especially since this is absolutely never a problem once the class itself begins...everyone gets into \"yoga mode\" right away and we're in that mode all the way through. However, like I said earlier in this post, it's really important to me to make sure that EVERY student is comfortable in my class. Short of rolling into the studio on Monday and telling everyone to \"pipe down,\" I guess I'm looking for a happy medium, if that makes sense??? I'd love for this student to NOT feel like class is being ruined for them, but I also am not really willing to stoop to the level of a third-grade teacher lecturing an unruly class that honestly isn't even unruly.\n\nI actually am not against a breathing exercise before the start of class, as this student mentioned..I guess the issue with that is, the yoga class is scheduled at a set time. Who am I to determine what the students do before that set time? It's a small gym, too, so having students congregate outside the studio room beforehand to do their chatting doesn't make sense nor do I think that type of congregation is even encouraged for safety reasons. Is it out of my bounds to ask students to do a breathing exercise before the class even begins?\n\nObviously, this is a thing I will be bringing up with my boss the next time I'm there, but since I have the weekend off to ponder this, I figured I'd see what my Reddit yogis think :) Any suggestions???\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Just want to thank everyone so much for responding!!! Basically everyone here is on the same track I was already on, so I feel better knowing my gut was going in a reasonable direction haha. Thanks again!"

However I wasn't sure whether I'd been doing it quite right. \n When holding positions in class I didn't really feel a stretch. My teacher said we should be relaxing into the moves and being aware of our limbs without discomfort. But I didn't feel a stretch unless I tensed/held an active position rather than letting gravity help me out.\nIs this just how yin yoga is supposed to feel or am I missing something in my practice? \nI've also read that yin is supposed to be more about the connective tissues in between muscles, so would this be why it doesn't feel like a big stretch?"

I've done enough fumbling over the years with yoga to know a few poses by now and the general approach, but I think it's time to get consistent and truly learn the basics. I'm not looking for medical advice, I've been to a physical therapist/specialist who tells me that many of my issues(tinnitus, visual migraines, memory loss, brain fog, poor sleep, and so on) are caused by tension on the vertebrae in my neck and upper back, which honestly makes a lot of sense to me. The exercises I have from the specialist are very gentle relaxation exercises/habits, encouraging the muscles to relax, whereas before, especially during yoga, I would stretch, twist and crack, thinking that was a good thing. So I wanted to continue this theory of practice and I know yoga can be great for encouraging relaxation, and a few gentle and safe stretches to help move into more advanced stuff comfortably later, would definitely not be unwelcome.\n\nDoes anyone know of any online, preferably short(30 minutes or less) routines that have that particular focus? Could be the same one or few routine(s), in fact, I'd rather have a daily ritual that I can gradually get better at than constantly having to switch things up. Hatha yoga would be the obvious go-to, but I'd also add I find breathwork(the relaxation exercises I'm doing has the breath at its center) and chakra stuff very intriguing, so some pointers on pranayama, either exercises or learning resources, would be great.\n\nThanks in advance."

However, looking at photos online I am actually seeing the lower hand being placed on the floor.\n\nSo, is extended side angle designed to be a stretch with the hand on the floor or a pose targeting the core with arms up in the air?\n\nI think this question can also apply to revolved triangle. Studio instructors at my local studio usually cue something like \"your lower arm/hand can be placed next to your front leg. Should I go ahead and place my hand on the floor in these poses if that is accessible to me?\n\nThanks for reading!"

      "reddit": "This seems to be a theme today with my clients so I thought I'd take a moment to reflect on it. Yes, the goal of yoga is to quiet the mind but that is not only for stress relief. It's much bigger than than that. Yoga today is about feeling good, relaxing and finding some time for ourselves in this very hectic society and lifestyle we find ourselves in. However, that is not the reason we practice.\n\nIn the yoga practice we do many things to help improve our physical and mental well being. What we are really after is that sense of peace and freedom we have when we end the lesson in sivasana, or the corpse pose. That alone is to make us embrace our mortality which is already work enough. It is supposed to give us a sense of separation from the body. This is not your body nor is it your mind. They are vehicles alone. In the corpse pose we are supposed to realise this. Here we are supposed to be able to completely separate from the flesh and connect with the spirit.\n\nOnce we can embrace that concept then we can look further to see the True Self as something completely different than these bones, flesh and thoughts that we have. That's the person we are trying to connect with. That is our own little piece of God right inside of us.\n\nWhen we are able to make this connection, it is ever so brief. You get this overwhelming sense of calm. You realise nothing else matters and you are content and happy with things just as they are. That's what it feels like to be connected with your True Self.\n\nThe more you practice the easier it is to get into that space, to reconnect with who you truly are. The longer you are able to stay in this space the stronger the connection becomes  and the easier it is to return to it in the future. This is where we truly reside, hence the body being only a vehicle, and in this space we can learn to hear and feel what we really want and who we really are.\n\nWe feel lost or uncertain only because we have lost the connection to reality by outside stimuli and the senses. Before we become active members of society, and live as free spirits (children), we live through this awareness of who we truly are. Then everything on the outside is exciting, amazing and wonderful. Thats why kids are so nice to be around. They live in the present more than we can ever hope for as adults. Society, responsibility and over stimulation take us away from our true nature. In doing yoga all we wish to do is to bring ourselves back to that natural state that we have lost.\n\nIt sounds easy but its a quest that we will be on for the rest of our lives. Thats why its called a yoga practice."

I've been cycling through YWA's three videos on lower back pain, which are pretty good, but well, that gets old. My back is healing pretty slowly and the physical therapy my doctor recommended doing basically consists of yoga poses, such as cat-cows. I'd appreciate any additional suggestions."

I got almost halfway through the 35? week sequence in Iyengar's Light on Yoga, but gave it up after reading The Science of Yoga and a few articles that suggested a lot of the poses don't really have any actual benefits and can cause harm. I want to know, where can I learn (mainly looking for books) more about yoga/stretching from an unbiased scientific/anatomical perspective? I don't care for the \"spiritual\" side of yoga, although I do enjoy the calming effect it has on my mind. Ultimately, I just want something that is going to help me stretch my muscles and improve my posture."

I’m working my way back to my practice, and am going through the growing pains of building up strength, endurance and flexibility again.\n\nI’m finding it incredibly challenging to do any lower body based asanas. A standing forward fold burns, and I cannot straighten my legs entirely. Seated forward fold always needs a bolster under my knees. Laying on my back with my legs up, whether one or both of them, using a strap, my leg(s) vibrate to the point I cannot hold them up, and once again I cannot straighten even with the extension of a strap.\n\nI don’t know how to approach this. Don’t push myself as hard? Is it my hams or quads causing the restriction? Is my core weak?  All of the above, and if so if I power through with a balanced practice and one day mm by mm I’ll get more comfortable?\n\nI know a part of this is striving, as I admire yogis who can seemingly just flatten there legs to the ground and fold over them, so I’m working on meeting myself where I am. \n\nHas anyone had similar experiences or advice on where to focus?"

I think my hamstrings are ok (not the greatest) now, and I can reach the floor now, but my tummy really does not touch my thigh that well when I fold, there is a big gap between them even if I suck in as much as I can. My thinking is that to forward bend, you need to get that space between your tummy and thighs closer to each other too? So do you forward fold with a slight bend in your knee to get them closer with time?"

I work 12 hour shifts, lift weights 4-6 days a week, train BJJ 3-4 days a week and I take long dog walks as often as possible.  I don't have time for a whole yoga class. I've been using [www.yogaforbjj.com](https://www.yogaforbjj.com) for a few weeks now and it was exactly what I needed... until it wasn't. I already lift and train hard, I don't have it in me to be doing the more aggressive calisthenic type stuff that the instructor was getting in to. I try and get the flow in after lifting, so lots of core and push-up type work is too much, my arms/legs/core are already exhausted.\n\nI'm hoping to find a 10-15 minute flow to work on my mobility, ideally something with some thoracic spine work (updogs, etc) and some hip openers (like pigeon). Something that I can do (almost) every day to help improve my movement, posture, etc. I have no urge to become a yoga practitioner, I just find the Vinyasa style stuff does wonders for movement and range of motion.\n\nSo, have you stumbled across anything like this? I don't mind paying for it if it is what I'm looking for."

Be mindful of your form in forward folds (to avoid pinching the sciatic nerve) as well as to complement strength stuff with stretching.

At first it started out great but eventually I started getting random annoying injuries and this has derailed my exercise routines. \n\nI started doing these exercises because I went to the docor with trouble sleeping and breathing and was diagnosed with depression?? \n\nHere's the kicker. I have some really flared ribs, but they're not flared because of muscle weakness or anything they're completely deformed. So as I'm looking into breathing exercises I noticed that it seems like I've always used my chest and shoulders to breath. So when I try to use my diaphram to breathe I get like half a full breath, maybe a little more.\n\nMy question to yogis is, can deformed ribs be the cause or affect of a dysfunctional diaphram? What sort of doc would I see to check this sort of thing out. \n\nIt's to the point where the orthopedic has me going to physical therapy for shoulder pain and I'm getting an mri on my shoulder but I don't think that is my issue. The np (still haven't actually seen the doctor because I'm pretty sure they just think I'm making this up) keeps telling me they can only treat pain but... It's not painful, I just can't breathe properly?? \n\nSo in practice have you seen any rib deformities impact the ability to breathe properly?"

I worry in my head about how do to the poses and criticizing if I'm doing them right. Like chair pose for example, I cant keep both heels down on the ground and cant squat right into it. And that's where the self doubt starts. I understand others aren't looking at me but I cant help but feel like such a novice coming into a class where people can do so much and I'm like uncomfortable in chair pose. \n\nI dont know if this post is allowed or if this is the right sub. I guess just some positive mojo might help get me unstuck. I went to a yoga festival on Saturday and had such a good time outdoors meeting new people and doing yoga I want to bring that happiness into a class where I normally feel the opposite.\n\n\nThanks in advance ��✌��"

Is it much risk for the spine or would you say it's okay? \n\nThank you for your thoughts!"

Crow, Side crow, Eight angle, Flying pigeon, Grasshopper Firefly... but these two just feel totally out of my league!\n\nIt is quite surprising to me because after firstly learning crow, I could usually get the \"hang\"/ \"feel\" of other arm balance poses and then practise it until I can hold it. But these two somehow feel like a total leap of skill. I'm crashing every day which is quite discouraging.\n\nFor those who have mastered the poses, how did you get there?  \nAre there some poses I should be learning in between? Or a particular muscle group I should be focusing on? \n\nThank You!"

Now, I have a membership at Planet Fitness but I kinda hate it. I don't like running and all the TVs and what not. I usually go, run a mile, do a core workout and go home. It's not helping me mentally and spiritually like yoga does but the physical aspect of yoga seems so tied in to the mentally restorative aspect of it. Should I start to meditate, should I go to the class and make up mods? I don't know, I just really miss the feeling and the community of it. Any suggestions would be helpful."

I took a headstand where I was, as I can get up and down in a controlled way without extending beyond the confines of my mat, and was still within legs-reach of the wall if I needed to tap a toe or whatever. Other people moved around, either to be closer to the wall, or create some space if they were experimenting with something new.\n\nThe guy next to me, however, decided he was going to do some wide-legged handstand variation, so he was aligned perpendicular to where I was, so that he could start with both feet on the mat, and did not choose to move his mat at all. So as he worked to get up, his feet were hovering inches from my upside down face, and he was blocking my whole mat, in such a way that had I needed to come out of my own pose, I could not have done so. At one point, he actually just put his feet down on *my* mat so that he could adjust his alignment, so he clearly knew exactly where he was. When I did have an opportunity to come out of the pose, I did so, but still didn't feel comfortable even resting in child's pose, because I was worried this dude was going to land on my back. \n\nIt was so frustrating in what's usually a grounding, relaxing time before savasana. It felt both not safe, and super rude, for no reason. Am I being fussy? Is this a common practice elsewhere?"

I initially learnt my Vinyasa flows by imitating others; my standard simple one flows from Downward facing Dog --&gt; High Plank --&gt; Chaturanga --&gt; Updog --&gt; Downward facing dog\n\nSo a few guidances were made today (thank you my Yoga Instructor!) to me to correct my poses: \n\n1. High Plank pose to ALWAYS engage Cow Spine, which I always forget\n2. Chaturanga to not \\*humfs\\* dump down (what I did was just dropping down to a level almost to the mat (about an inch off - more like dumping myself down to this \"default hovering pose\" that is much lower than a 90 degree angle in my arms) - now I know I need to maintain the 90 degree angle)\n3. From here : I used to **SLIDE/GLIDE** (somewhat like a snake down to the ground and upwards) to Updog -- but was corrected to just **straighten** my arms! Naturally it forms a Cobra/Updog.\n\nAnyway long story short, I was wondering what is the \"correct\" method we should do with? Is there any benefits at all doing a slide/glide in comparison to just straightening? I suppose by just straightening it might prevent any movements between the hands and feet so we continuously stay at a good position throughout. \n\nAny thoughts?"

It upsets me greatly as I can’t practice yoga for at least 6 weeks, which is pretty depressing. \nI thought I could build up a collection of poses that don’t engage the core - which I know goes against a basic principle of yoga- but it least I could still have a gentle practice in the time being.  All suggestions are welcomed :-)"

      "reddit": "Hi all,\n\nI received some great advice and videos here with an earlier post so I thought I'd come back for some more. First off I know that the recommended route is joining a class but it's not an option for me for personal reasons I'd rather not go into right now :)\n\nThat said, I'm looking to find some yoga sequences/styles that I can practice which carry the least inherent risk of injury to my back. I've read a couple of books by Dr Stuart McGill who is an expert on back injury and is of the opinion that back flexion/extension under load wears out your spin over time and makes you more at risk of back injuries, and in general everything he advocates involves keeping a neutral spine.\n\nI've started following this advice in my non-yoga exercise routine (mainly strength training). So when I watch myself in the mirror trying to do some common yoga poses like forward folds I wince a bit because I can see how my back rounds despite my best efforts. Another thing I wince at is the process of rising up from a downward dog in the Sun Salutation A (where you bring your feet forward and then stand up straight, my spine is never neutral here).\n\nMaybe it's because my hamstrings aren't flexible enough yet and I guess that will come with time and more practice. But until that point what kind of sequences/videos would you recommend that don't involve 'risky' poses like the forward fold where it's tougher to keep your spine neutral?"

Basically he would carefully drape a warm towel over the part of your body he would touch -- back, shoulders, hips, etc. Then he would do the adjustments and massage type things over that. The only time I remember him not using a towel was when he did temple or forehead massages during Savasana. It was soothing to have that warm and soft towel draped over you, and his adjustments were always so strong and firm. He also told me that the towel helped him to stabilize himself when someone was sweaty and he needed to touch bare skin, meaning that he could be just as firm on slippery skin as on clothed or dry skin. Great stuff."

I initially learnt my Vinyasa flows by imitating others; my standard simple one flows from Downward facing Dog --&gt; High Plank --&gt; Chaturanga --&gt; Updog --&gt; Downward facing dog\n\nSo a few guidances were made today (thank you my Yoga Instructor!) to me to correct my poses: \n\n1. High Plank pose to ALWAYS engage Cow Spine, which I always forget\n2. Chaturanga to not \\*humfs\\* dump down (what I did was just dropping down to a level almost to the mat (about an inch off - more like dumping myself down to this \"default hovering pose\" that is much lower than a 90 degree angle in my arms) - now I know I need to maintain the 90 degree angle)\n3. From here : I used to **SLIDE/GLIDE** (somewhat like a snake down to the ground and upwards) to Updog -- but was corrected to just **straighten** my arms! Naturally it forms a Cobra/Updog.\n\nAnyway long story short, I was wondering what is the \"correct\" method we should do with? Is there any benefits at all doing a slide/glide in comparison to just straightening? I suppose by just straightening it might prevent any movements between the hands and feet so we continuously stay at a good position throughout. \n\nAny thoughts?"

I've been cycling through YWA's three videos on lower back pain, which are pretty good, but well, that gets old. My back is healing pretty slowly and the physical therapy my doctor recommended doing basically consists of yoga poses, such as cat-cows. I'd appreciate any additional suggestions."

Feet rooted down, thighs and glutes engaged, calves slightly externally rotated, shoulders back, chest open, navel pulled to spine to puff out middle back. Try to use your core to pull your back to touch the wall without rounding your shoulders. \n\n It's like the simplest but hardest thing, but that mechanic of pulling in your core will strengthen your inversion whether it's a head stand or handstand :)"

As soon as you have some stability holding your body upside down, move away from the way and practice kicking up and 'walking' out of your handstand...as you start to go past vertical, pivot on one arm and land on your feet. This will help overcome the fear of falling. After that you're on your way to free standing handstand... just plan on a ton of practice...."

      "reddit": "Hi everyone! First time I have posted in a while, just looking to see if anyone has experienced something similar/any teachers can offer advice.  \nI had been attending a weekly led ashtanga class for a year up until about 6 months ago when my work committments changed and I couldn't make it to the class anymore. From there I tried to keep up my home practice as well as possible and attended whatever workshops at the weekend that I could. I have started trying to get back into the ashtanga swing of things (easing into it as its a big practice for me) and have started doing the primary series led, up to navasana which is as far as I am comfortable with practicing at home. Jump throughs/backs are my biggest challenge so I am trying to step slowly and mindfully rather than jumping, until I can build up the strength to jump in a more controlled way. Recently I have noticed (which I did get to some extent when I attended class, but its worse now I'm practicing on my own) that the day after ashtanga, the only muscle pain I get is in my neck and feels like whiplash, its quite agonizing and takes several days to ease off again. Has anyone ever experienced this before with an ashtanga practice? Any ideas what I am doing wrong to cause it? The way I see it, ashtanga isn't a very \"neck intensive\" sequence so I didn't think I was working it this hard... is there drishtis that I should focus on to prevent this? I do like the practice once I get into the habit of doing it, but obviously consistent pain like that can be off-putting, and tbh I'm sure its something I'm doing. Have some videos of some of my practices if anyone thinks this would help. \n\nTL/DR: ashtanga yoga home practice causing whiplash pains - is there anything that I can focus on to prevent this?"

When I try, for example, the ananda balasana i feel like a blade stuck in my hips.\n\nI've found on this sub a very interesting tutorial on how to address hamstrings tightness. Could you please help me release the other muscles as well?\n\nThank you."

It doesn't matter if they are closer to the beginning or end of my practice or whether I have stretched them out yet or used them at all or not.\n\nEither way I would like this to stop happening so I can progress in these poses.\n\nAlso in other balance poses (dancers, eagle, extended tree) the outside of my grounding ankle burns, is that normal? I can usually breathe through it but it is rather painful.\n\nThanks!"

I could take over a small country on my right leg.  On my left leg I become the leaning tower of Pisa. If someone gently coughs, the slight gust of air blows me over like a feather.  I become as unsteady and shaky as an 8th grader trying to get to second base, even when using my right foot as a kick stand.\n\nMy enlightened teachers say things like, “that’s where the yoga begins” and “yoga isn’t about ego.”  I used to spiritually appreciate the tasty karmic humble pie that left-legged tree pose serves up.  I even go stand by the wall when this nemesis pose comes up to symbolically declare to the universe and my fellow yogis that I suck at left-side tree pose.  I get the sun/moon, yin/yang, male/female thing.  But I’m a Libra and I need symmetry!  I even practice in my kitchen or in line at the store.  That being said, after 9 months of little progress, I surrender!  I think I’m doing all of the fundamentals correctly.  What else can I do?"

The other practitioners around you are focused on their own practice, so don't feel self-conscious about that either.\n\nIf you somehow have the misfortune of visiting a studio that isn't giving you positive, healthy vibes, find one that does.  Lord knows there are plenty around.\n\nOne final note on mirrors.  Mirrors in studios are really important for helping us modify and improve our positioning and alignment.  An instructor might say something (e.g., \"make sure your shoulders are back and you're standing with a straight back\").  You may think that you're doing that, but years of bad posture (me) have left you unaware of how you actually stand.  I realize that the association we have with mirrors is largely based around vanity, but the mirrors in yoga studios are primarily about function.  Use them with that mindset to work on and improving your practice. \n\nGood luck.  You'll love it."

I love her style and I've watched all her videos multiple times. My first yoga practices were with Adriene, but I as started to learn, I needed more. I found Erin's channel and it was harder at the beginning, but I fell in love with her classes. She is focused on vinyasa yoga. The classes can be oriented around certain body parts (there is also a lot of strength building, never thought I would get nice sculpted arms, my male friends are impressed), or there are peak pose build up sessions. Furthermore they are often filmed in beautiful outdoor locations, in Costa Rica or Nicaragua.\n\nI am trying to support her as much as I can (already a patreon) and I hope she gets more subscribers."

I took a headstand where I was, as I can get up and down in a controlled way without extending beyond the confines of my mat, and was still within legs-reach of the wall if I needed to tap a toe or whatever. Other people moved around, either to be closer to the wall, or create some space if they were experimenting with something new.\n\nThe guy next to me, however, decided he was going to do some wide-legged handstand variation, so he was aligned perpendicular to where I was, so that he could start with both feet on the mat, and did not choose to move his mat at all. So as he worked to get up, his feet were hovering inches from my upside down face, and he was blocking my whole mat, in such a way that had I needed to come out of my own pose, I could not have done so. At one point, he actually just put his feet down on *my* mat so that he could adjust his alignment, so he clearly knew exactly where he was. When I did have an opportunity to come out of the pose, I did so, but still didn't feel comfortable even resting in child's pose, because I was worried this dude was going to land on my back. \n\nIt was so frustrating in what's usually a grounding, relaxing time before savasana. It felt both not safe, and super rude, for no reason. Am I being fussy? Is this a common practice elsewhere?"

The sequence started with an extended child's pose like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqVMAPM00DM) where you use your fingertips to reach out and stretch your back with your head down, then it transitions into an upward facing dog or a cobra. Not sure which one it is but the transition occurred after you try to reach out with your hands as far as possible during the extended child's pose, to stretch your back. The transition to the upward dog or cobra keeps your nose at the same distance from the ground. It's like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HerlEPvo5es) but the other way around starting from child's pose then to cobra, and keeping your nose to the ground as you move your head forward and into the cobra or upward dog."

      "reddit": "Hi, all! I practice yoga about 3-5 times a week and have been for the last couple years. My flexibility and strength has definitely increased and my hip flexors have gained more flexibility as well, but for the past few months or so I have been experiencing what appears to be \"snapping hip syndrome\" which doesn't seem uncommon, but both hips snap pretty loudly now and it is getting to a point where I am experiencing pain in both hips from just walking/sitting/sleeping etc. I never used to feel pain when my hips snapped, but now it's pretty evident and a little concerning. I also figured that with regular yoga that it would help this condition and not worsen it. There have also been moments during certain postures or other activities where my hips \"lock up\" in pain, so I have to take it easy or stop...I can live in pigeon pose, but a yogi squat kills!\n\nDoes anyone have any experience or insight on this? Are there other exercises you would recommend, and if it's turning in to regular pain and discomfort, should I see a PT or is that unnecessary? Appreciate the time and insight, thanks!"

      "reddit": "I'm late to the party, but wanted to throw my two cents in.\n\nI primarily do hot yoga and it is just *so* awesome! Here are my necessities:\n\n* Yoga towel (some ppl use a regular towel) over your yoga mat. This is essential, otherwise you will slip and slide all over your mat.\n\n* My studio offers a basket of hand-towels to use. This super helpful! I keep a hand towel at the head of my mat so that I can grab it while in forward fold to quickly wipe my face/arms when needed.\n\n* I'm always surprised people don't mention a head-band for hot yoga. I have to wear a headband on my forehead to 1) keep hair back and, more importantly, 2) to keep sweat out of my eyes! Bonus points if it is a wide headband so you can cover your ears if needed. I will pull my headband over my ears at the end of class during floor work (i.e., bridge, savasana, etc) to keep sweat out of my ears!\n\n* I don't know if you are male or female, but I personally recommend long yoga pants opposed to shorts. I find I need the friction of the pants to hold any arm balances; otherwise my legs slip off my triceps with shorts on.\n\nKeep in mind, your first time in a hot yoga class can feel overwhelming with the heat. Take it easy and rest in savasana if you feel the need. It might take several classes for you to get used to working out in a heated room. Also, I don't recommend eating before class. I intentionally attend hot yoga classes on an empty stomach, otherwise I might get nausea or experience heartburn. With that in mind, I also do not attempt to hydrate *during* a hot yoga class. Hydrate before or after class! \n\nAnother tip: be careful about over-stretching in a hot yoga class. Typically, you can go deeper into poses in a hot yoga class, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea. Listen to your body. Injuries can happen if you overdo it in stretching poses! (speaking from experience, unfortunately!)\n\nAs an aside- I also sweat profusely. Even my forearms will be dripping sweat during class and I will look around and see that no one else's forearms are sweaty. haha! It's cool though. Embrace the heat, embrace the sweat, and you will learn to LOVE it!"

I am also aware that yoga is not like straight up just balancing, but I have no idea what subreddit could help. \n\nTLDR: How do I help my girlfriend become a balance master? Is it just as simple as just... doing balance positions?"

I just recently started breathing the correct way and my shoulders and neck have started to really Crack and my posture is getting a little better. \n\nI was paradoxically breathing into my chest using my neck and shoulders. Now that I'm using my diaphram I'm pretty sure all the muscles I WAS using are now loosening up and it feels painful/relieving. I'm really just looking for any info or experience with this.\n\nI've also been trying to increase flexibility in my spine and intercostals where I can. \n\nThis has come with some very strange head rushes and my vision even seems to randomly get better, but noticibly so. \n\nBy doing yoga and stretches and what not can you unlock ribs bones and nerves that could be causing this?\n\nThanks for any advice tips or pointers!"

I mainly practice vinyasa, and tend to go to one or two instructors, so I'm sure I only know a tiny percentage of what is out there. \n\nThanks!"

Yoga classes vary tremendously in length and intensity, so while some classes are vigorous enough to help with weight loss, others are not, though they may offer an array of other benefits.\n\nIf you're interested specifically in weight loss, I recommend looking into vinyasa classes. These classes typically repeat somewhat vigorous sequences and move practitioners on and off the floor, which is a full body movement.\n\nMost yoga classes do not raise the heart rate high enough to offer much cardiovascular work (yes, there are exceptions, but most do not). It would be a good idea to, with the guidance of your doctor, develop a separate cardio routine to complement your yoga practice."

I can only hold both for about 20-30 seconds before my hands hurt and I am shaking. There aren’t really any modifications to these that I have found. I am trying to power through it to better myself later on. Another thing I have noticed is that I am sweating and panting near the end of the video. Is this bad? Am I disrespecting the yoga culture by not being able to breathe correctly at the end?"

Studios can only stay alive it seems by offering all these workout-focused classes that are hot and fast with loud music, and majority of people like that! How can we get back to the beautiful simplicity of the teachings, while still (as studios and teachers) stay alive? Thoughts on this?"

I don’t really know what word to use here. \nLook, I don’t do yoga to burn fat, get in shape or anything like that. I do it to feel good in my body. And I don’t have to typical “yoga body”. I’m short and kind of stocky/compact build. \n\nMy teachers first comment was when I did equestrian pose and didn’t have my palms completely in the mat. \n“Don’t be lazy now!”.. \nThat happened two times. And I actually caught myself forcing my palms down the mat and the pose felt completely wrong for my body. I did the pose several times, and every time I didn’t have the palms in the mat she said something like “don’t be lazy! You’re only fooling yourself, you’re not fooling me!” \nAnd I’m just here like... I’m not here to fool anybody, I’m here to do yoga and feel good. \nI suddenly felt that I had to prove myself for this teacher, and it actually affected me way, way more than first anticipated. Yoga always make me feel good about myself and my body, and this time I felt horrible. I felt fat and short and stiff and weak... \n\nIm gonna go tomorrow again, and fortunately it’s my favorite instructor doing the class.."

I've done enough fumbling over the years with yoga to know a few poses by now and the general approach, but I think it's time to get consistent and truly learn the basics. I'm not looking for medical advice, I've been to a physical therapist/specialist who tells me that many of my issues(tinnitus, visual migraines, memory loss, brain fog, poor sleep, and so on) are caused by tension on the vertebrae in my neck and upper back, which honestly makes a lot of sense to me. The exercises I have from the specialist are very gentle relaxation exercises/habits, encouraging the muscles to relax, whereas before, especially during yoga, I would stretch, twist and crack, thinking that was a good thing. So I wanted to continue this theory of practice and I know yoga can be great for encouraging relaxation, and a few gentle and safe stretches to help move into more advanced stuff comfortably later, would definitely not be unwelcome.\n\nDoes anyone know of any online, preferably short(30 minutes or less) routines that have that particular focus? Could be the same one or few routine(s), in fact, I'd rather have a daily ritual that I can gradually get better at than constantly having to switch things up. Hatha yoga would be the obvious go-to, but I'd also add I find breathwork(the relaxation exercises I'm doing has the breath at its center) and chakra stuff very intriguing, so some pointers on pranayama, either exercises or learning resources, would be great.\n\nThanks in advance."

I put my foot behind my head during my yoga practice and I think that I put too much pressure on some nerves and then I stayed in this position for too long (30-60 seconds). I realized immediately after this that it somehow felt numb. It's only a small part of my calf, just the region that was touching the back of my head. I thought that with time it will be better, but it's the same. I have no problem walking, doing sports or anything, but when I touch the skin at this particular point of my calf, it just feels \"weird\". Has any of you had an experience like this? If so, how long did it take for the numbness to go away? Is there any treatment?"

Last year, my favorite teacher announced that she was moving, and recommended me for teacher training, and I said yes. I now teach 2 beginner level classes and am considered a teacher in training. \n\nNow that my favorite teacher has moved, I have been attending the studio owner’s classes and training under her. Let’s call her Stacey. \n\nI had attended Stacey’s classes before my favorite teacher moved, and while she wasn’t particularly friendly, she was knowledgeable and her classes were good. \n\nTraining under Stacey has been absolutely awful. She actually yells at me in class, in front of students, if I am doing the poses wrong. Sometimes she will ask me to assist her while she is teaching, and has yelled at me if I’m not assisting correctly to the point it makes me cry. She uses embarrassment to correct me, like if I have the wrong arm position, she will stand next to me and tap her foot and sigh until I figure out what I’m doing wrong. She has slapped me on the back once while making an “adjustment” and pushed me out of Vrksasana once during a teacher training exercise. \n\nIn the past year, she has had several teachers quit including my favorite teacher that moved, which makes me believe I’m not the only one that doesn’t like working with her. However, she does have one other teacher that has been with the studio long term, and I wonder how she does it? \n\nI reached out to my favorite teacher and told her what was going on, and she said “yeah she treated me that way too. She’s hard on you because she likes you.”\n\nI’m trying to figure out what to do. I have a day job that supports me financially. This was supposed to be for fun. It’s not fun. I actually like teaching yoga but find it a little overwhelming to do with my day job (45 hours per week). \n\nThis is my dilemma. I love the style of yoga I do, and there isn’t another studio nearby with this style. I like my yoga friends, and would miss them if I left. I am thinking of just trying out taking classes at other studios nearby to see how it is, and if I find a good match, then resign. The only thing is, it’s a small town and a lot of students at my studio attend at other studios too, so others would know if I’m trying out other studios. \n\nI have thought about sticking it out until I move in about 5 years, but I don’t know if my mental health can take it. I like teaching yoga but would prefer to be a student first. \n\nAlso, if anyone has advice on resigning as a yoga teacher, I would love to hear it. \n\nTl;dr my yoga boss is a bully, but I like this style of yoga and miss my favorite teacher. I would also love advice on how to resign as a yoga teacher."

I have often taken the arms off my chairs but the base of the chair is usually too small or too curved to let me sit comfotably. I have pondered it myself for a while now but I thought I might as well consolt the experts ;).

It's been life-changing.\n\nObviously I'm not an expert at this yet and unfortunately, my work is taking me away from the teacher and class for the coming months. I want to keep practising my asana's, they're doing my back a world of good. \n\nWithout a teacher to show me and correct me, I'd like to have a book I can use to stay fresh on each position and as a reminder for which muscle groups each asana focuses on.\n\nIn this particular case, I'm not too interested in the philosophical side of yoga. Just a practical guide with a step by step of important asanas and an explanation on which parts of the body they're supposed to stretch or strengthen. Additional information on how to do simplified versions of asanas I can't quite manage yet is also welcome.\n\nSo if you have any recommendations let me know."

You could have made the point about getting it covered as an assistance without talking down about the medication and therapy, that rarely gets covered by insurance and only usually after a deductible and a huge co-pay. Do I think we can also benefit from different options for meditation and yoga and other non-medication related practices, sure! Do I think that works for everyone? Fuck no."

Due to this hypermobility, I am not accustomed to having trouble accessing poses but the one that seems to have given me the most trouble over the years is seated wide angle posture. I am fine in seated forward fold and also in wide-leg forward fold (standing). However, when I move my legs into seated wide angle pose, I get an extremely intense sensation along the inner thighs even if my legs are at less than 90 degrees. Any ideas on what this could be a sign of? How to better release this tightness? One of my guesses is that it could be the inner thighs tightening to make up for the looseness of my hips... Any guidance or ideas welcome!"

Prior to this injury I was doing yoga regularly, and I really want to get back into a practice but have trouble accepting this new \"normal\"....but hopefully not normal forever. I lose the arterial bloodflow when I raise my left arm above my head. My right arm is fine and my strength on both sides is pretty good. Does anyone have any resources or modified pose ideas they can share? For instance, I can do warrior one, but I keep my left hand on my hip and extend my right arm up. Thanks guys! I think the biggest thing is just not getting discouraged with this and lots of trial and error."

It’s already been kind of an emotional and personal journey for me, and I really look at it as my personal safe space. \n\nToday I felt completely horrible during and after my practice. \nI decided to take a class even though I felt kind of tired in my body, but my head needed a break. \nThe practice itself was alright. \nBut the instructor was very.. ambitious? I don’t really know what word to use here. \nLook, I don’t do yoga to burn fat, get in shape or anything like that. I do it to feel good in my body. And I don’t have to typical “yoga body”. I’m short and kind of stocky/compact build. \n\nMy teachers first comment was when I did equestrian pose and didn’t have my palms completely in the mat. \n“Don’t be lazy now!”.. \nThat happened two times. And I actually caught myself forcing my palms down the mat and the pose felt completely wrong for my body. I did the pose several times, and every time I didn’t have the palms in the mat she said something like “don’t be lazy! You’re only fooling yourself, you’re not fooling me!” \nAnd I’m just here like... I’m not here to fool anybody, I’m here to do yoga and feel good. \nI suddenly felt that I had to prove myself for this teacher, and it actually affected me way, way more than first anticipated. Yoga always make me feel good about myself and my body, and this time I felt horrible. I felt fat and short and stiff and weak... \n\nIm gonna go tomorrow again, and fortunately it’s my favorite instructor doing the class.."

Due to some mental health issues and a medication change, I gained 60 lbs over the course of about a year and a half, which I am now working to get off via diet and exercise. \n\nI really miss yoga and would like to get back to it, so I’ve started the 30 days of Yoga with Adrienne. As much as I like her, and feel better overall after a practice, OH DEAR GOD are some things uncomfortable, to the point of pain- my knees hurt in cat/cow, my freaking butt bones hurt in boat. While I truly believe plus sized women can do yoga and kick ass at it, at this point that extra sixty lbs feels like it’s killing me! I should mention too that this extra weight puts me in the BMI category of obese- a size 16-18 at 5’5. On my frame it is very uncomfortable and as stated, it is something I’m working on to better my health. In the meantime though- does anyone have any suggestions? Practicing on a thicker mat didn’t seem to make a difference. Am I resigned to avoiding these poses until I can reduce the strain on my joints by losing some of this weight?"

I can feel the floor beneath me, supporting me. I can feel my body pulsating to the rhythm of my heart beat. I exhale. A bead of sweat rolls between my parted lips and finds its home on my tongue. It tastes good. I wipe the sweat from around my mouth and return my arm to the floor beside me. My mind is clear but for the sounds and sensations in this place, in this moment. I feel each baby hair on my upper lip and chin release itself from my skin to stand at attention once more. The door of this room opens. I can hear the soft padding of bare feet. The door closes. I wiggle my toes to prove they’re still there. I press my shoulders into the floor. A breath of cool air tickles my toes. It moves ever so slowly up my leg, as if it knows it’s not supposed to be here. Not in this room. And then it is gone. Was it ever there? A figment of my imagination? I inhale. I thank my body for the work it has done. I exhale.\n\nShavasana"

I feel like I need more help specifically with what direction my hips should be facing and what to do with my shoulders (since these areas of my body seem to just do what they want.) I love classes but I’m not getting that level of instruction there either. Signed up for some beginner Iyengar classes that I hope will be more helpful.

I stopped yoga to recuperate mentally/emotionally from this injury but have returned to the practice at a much lower intensity despite not having resolved the injury. Should I do postures on the healthy side that I can no longer do on the other side? Or should I stick to only doing postures that are accessible on both sides? Why/why not?\n\nI have accepted that my right quad will begin to atrophy, although I can still do some work to maintain hamstring/glute strength. The typical ways we might strengthen the left quad in yoga (various warrior/lunge postures) are not accessible because they place the right knee in a vulnerable position. However, bodyweight exercises like one legged pistol squat are still doable for left leg. Is there any reason not to continue to strengthen this other leg other?"

I am a highly anxious, frequently stressed out person. When I am taking a yoga class, the last thing I want to think about is my to-do list, or my job, or everything that needs to get done at home, etc...\n\nFor me, this means that all of my focus is on each pose and nothing else. Fast-pace classes are great for me opposed to classes where there are a lot of static poses, because I don't like time to think and let all of those stress-filled thoughts enter my head again. At the same time, I like the opportunity to explore my full-range of motion so I personally love it when instructors cue 2-3 rounds of a pose (e.g., 2 rounds of bridge before going into wheel). \n\nWhile I enjoy fast paced classes, that also doesn't mean I want to hurry through a pose with bad form. I appreciate instructors who cue flows, while also respecting that I might take my time to go through each pose. I suppose a good example of this would be flowing through plank --&gt; chataranga--&gt; up-dog --&gt; down-dog. I like it when instructors tell me to \"go through your flow\" and then \"meet in down-dog\" so that I can flow through my chataranga in my own time and pause longer in down-dog.\n\nI really enjoy classes with instructors who guide their students through modifications and offer corrections (either verbal or hands-on) as those verbal reminders are really important for safety (I always forget to engage my core)! Aside from that, I'm not picky about music during the class, but I especially enjoy nature sounds (i.e., waves crashing, birds singing) for savasana.\n\nInstructors who are open to questions and discussion after class are worth their weight in gold. I also appreciate instructors who might pause class before a sequence to remind students proper form and demonstrate that proper form."

I was extremely let down and felt it was very dangerous, nothing like any of my previous yoga experiences. I had no idea about the controversy surrounding Bikram yoga until I searched if it was safe or even a \"real\" yoga form (loosely used, I'm not an elitist; it just felt so different than other yoga types). There was no flow, and you keep going from savasana to all these other poses which is extremely unnatural. I kept getting light headed and dizzy because there was no time for me to grab a drink (this may or may not be the instructor's timing, though). It was not focused on grounding you in the moment or appreciating and caring for your body. We were repeatedly told to lock our knees and force our knees down, and to push our body as far as we could, which I have never experienced before. It was 90 miserable minutes where I couldnt get my feet grounded or hold poses because of how wet I was. What are everyone's thoughts on Bikram Yoga?"

      "reddit": "Seems like most old yogic texts encourage breathing that is: gentle, shallow, slow etc. similar to the more modern breathing practice r/buteyko - ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgwxn9mRpAY&amp;t=519s))\n\n  Lao Tzu (circa 400BC)\n\n&gt;   A Perfect Man Breathes As If He Is Not Breathing\n\nThe Yoga Sutra of Patanjali (4th-2nd century BC) \n\n&gt; Pranayama [the main breathing exercise in yoga] is the cessation of\n&gt; inspiratory and expiratory movements.\n\nThe Gheranda Samhita (15-17 century)\n\n&gt; (7) Whenever the yogi may be, he should always, in everything he does,\n&gt; be sure to keep the tongue upwards and constantly hold the breath.\n&gt; This is Nabhomudra, the destroyer of diseases for yogis. \"\n\n\nThe Shiva Samhita (17-18 century)\n\n&gt; (23) Again, let him draw breath through the right nostril, and stop breathing as long as his strength permits; then let him expel the air\n&gt; through the left nostril, not forcibly, but slowly and gently.\n&gt; \n&gt; (39) When the Yogi can, of his will, regulate the air and stop the breath (whenever and how long) he likes, then certainly he gets\n&gt; success in kumbhaka, and from the success in kumbhaka only, what\n&gt; things cannot the Yogi commend here?\n&gt; \n&gt; (43) ... from the perfection of pranayama, follows decrease of sleep, excrements, and urine.\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nKapalbhati is first mentioned in Gheranda Samhita which was written around 1700 C.E so 300 years old or so. \n\nhttp://www.ghoshyoga.org/blog/roots-of-ghosh-yoga-the-gheranda-samhita\n\n&gt;The Gheranda Samhita, written in around 1700 C.E., is the most encyclopedic of the hathayoga texts. It was likely composed in the Bengal region of India, the same region that houses Kolkata and Ghosh's College. This text was available in Bengali, a regional language spoken by ordinary people, as opposed to the sacred Sanskrit, so it had an outsized impact on yoga's development in the last few hundred years.\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;The last few chapters of the Gheranda Samhita cover topics that have largely been lost to modern western iterations of yoga. Admittedly, they are often difficult and require significant effort and persistence. In Ghosh's lineage, the practice of pranayama has been whittled down to Kapalbhati, with Sitali offered to some advanced students. Mudras and Pratyahara are more advanced still.\n\nhttps://www.yogapoint.com/info/kapalbhati.htm\n\n\n&gt; REFERENCES IN THE ANCIENT TEXTS\n\n&gt; Gherandsamhita describes Kapalbhati in its first chapter. Gherandsamhitakar state while describing the three types of Kapalbhati :\n&gt; \n&gt; G S 1.54\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; There are three types of Kapalbhati - Vatkrama, Vyutkrama and Sheetkram. By performing kapalbhati doshas of kapha are eliminated.\n&gt; The next shloka describes Vatkram Kapalbhati.\n&gt; \n&gt; G S 1.55\n&gt; \n&gt; The air should be inhaled with Ida Nadi ( left nostril ) and exhaled through Pingala Nadi ( right nostril ). Again the process should be performed in a reverse manner.\n&gt; \n&gt; G S 1.56\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Pooraka and Rechaka should be performed rapidly, without performing Kumbhaka. This eliminates kapha doshas.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then Vyutkrama and Sheetkrama Kapalbhatis are described. However, we will see them under the chapter Neti.\n&gt; \n&gt; The process of Kapalbhati that we have studied so far is different from that stated in Gherandsamhita. Hathapradeepikakars have described Kapalbhati in a more correct manner.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2-35\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; When Pooraka and Rechaka are performed rapidly as in bellows of a blacksmith. It is known as Kapalbhati. The study of Kapalbhati reduces kapha doshas.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both Gherandsamhita and Hathapradeepikakars agree that the practice of Kapalbhati eliminates kapha doshas. Hathapradeepikakar describes the process in detail. And the simile used by them is very apt in the sense that if one observes the movement of the bellows, the fan is pressed to release the air out with force and then loosened to let the air in with natural ease. Similarly, a forceful rechaka and natural pooraka with rapid movement is expected in Kapalbhati. Hence, the description by Hathapradeepikakar is more proper and clear than that given by Gherandsamhita and is more in vogue.\n&gt; \n\n---\n\nSo we know its at least 300 years old. but Do we know how old it really is ?\n\nBonus questions do you think that everyday breathing should be \n\n- gentle or forced?\n- silent or audible?\n- nose or mouth?\n- diaphragmatic or belly?\n- small or big?\n- slow or fast?\n- deep or shallow?"

It doesn't matter if they are closer to the beginning or end of my practice or whether I have stretched them out yet or used them at all or not.\n\nEither way I would like this to stop happening so I can progress in these poses.\n\nAlso in other balance poses (dancers, eagle, extended tree) the outside of my grounding ankle burns, is that normal? I can usually breathe through it but it is rather painful.\n\nThanks!"

No matter how I seem to adjust my hips or chest I can’t seem to get them aligned.  My lower right back always feels so much tighter than my left in day to day activities and the same goes for my right hip flexor.  Based on these descriptions is there anything I can do to mediate this issue? Thanks"

I’m 21 years old and not terribly unfit but have dreadful posture and am the least flexible person I know. When I do child’s pose it hurts my inner thighs. When I try downwards dog I can’t get my feet down from my tip toes and although I’ve seen people say to bend your legs and keep your back straight I physically can’t - just trying hurts my lower back and shoulders. My wrists hurt when I put any pressure on them.  Etc. Almost every part of my body hurts too much to continue whenever I try. I’m not aware of any injuries or health issues - I’m just that inflexible. \n\nI had hoped yoga would make me more flexible, but the pain caused by being inflexible makes it extremely difficult and unpleasant to try for long enough to see any results. I’m at a loss. Any ideas?"

However I wasn't sure whether I'd been doing it quite right. \n When holding positions in class I didn't really feel a stretch. My teacher said we should be relaxing into the moves and being aware of our limbs without discomfort. But I didn't feel a stretch unless I tensed/held an active position rather than letting gravity help me out.\nIs this just how yin yoga is supposed to feel or am I missing something in my practice? \nI've also read that yin is supposed to be more about the connective tissues in between muscles, so would this be why it doesn't feel like a big stretch?"

Learn that really well and bring it to your one leg balance poses, with one leg. As soon as you lose Tadasana leg you have lost the pose. Attempting more at that point will only causes problems.\n\nE: Definitely use the wall or chair in the balance poses just a little to learn this. So you can really concentrate on maintaining that proper use of the leg."

Can anyone here offer any advice/recommendations on ways to think about shoulder placement in chaturanga? Can anyone offer any shoulder exercises I can do outside of yoga in order to prevent this pronation? \n\n(Side note- it probably doesn't help that I sit at a computer at work for much of my day!)\n\nIf anyone is able to offer any additional insight into the anatomy behind the shoulders in chaturanga, that would be appreciated. I've been wondering if I also have weakness in my deltoid muscles or upper/mid traps that are contributing to this shoulder issue.\n\nThanks for reading!"

      "reddit": "Hi everyone! First time I have posted in a while, just looking to see if anyone has experienced something similar/any teachers can offer advice.  \nI had been attending a weekly led ashtanga class for a year up until about 6 months ago when my work committments changed and I couldn't make it to the class anymore. From there I tried to keep up my home practice as well as possible and attended whatever workshops at the weekend that I could. I have started trying to get back into the ashtanga swing of things (easing into it as its a big practice for me) and have started doing the primary series led, up to navasana which is as far as I am comfortable with practicing at home. Jump throughs/backs are my biggest challenge so I am trying to step slowly and mindfully rather than jumping, until I can build up the strength to jump in a more controlled way. Recently I have noticed (which I did get to some extent when I attended class, but its worse now I'm practicing on my own) that the day after ashtanga, the only muscle pain I get is in my neck and feels like whiplash, its quite agonizing and takes several days to ease off again. Has anyone ever experienced this before with an ashtanga practice? Any ideas what I am doing wrong to cause it? The way I see it, ashtanga isn't a very \"neck intensive\" sequence so I didn't think I was working it this hard... is there drishtis that I should focus on to prevent this? I do like the practice once I get into the habit of doing it, but obviously consistent pain like that can be off-putting, and tbh I'm sure its something I'm doing. Have some videos of some of my practices if anyone thinks this would help. \n\nTL/DR: ashtanga yoga home practice causing whiplash pains - is there anything that I can focus on to prevent this?"

Do you have a set series of poses like ashtanga?  Thank you in advance for any answers.

There's a marked increase in heart rate, too. It's not every day, but when it happens it's 99% of the time towards the end of the day.\n\nWith this, I get dizziness and sometimes a faint feeling – never fainted from it. When I'm having these issues, I'm always extremely tight around the neck, shoulders and upper back. At it's worst, it's accompanied by tension headaches.\n\nAs a small business owner, I sit and work long hours in-front of a computer screen. So I think this is the cause of my issue. I've been for multiple doctor checkups and had all sorts of tests done. Everything comes back fine.\n\nThis has been an issue for about 6 years now. It is sometimes worse and sometimes better. The times when it's better, I'm observing better posture, using a standing desk, doing yoga regularly, etc etc. And all the things you'd expect. It's also better after a shower (heat and muscle relaxing, I guess).\n\nOver the years, I've tried yoga, massage, acupuncture, myofascial release &amp; massage/lacrosse ball work, etc etc etc.\n\nI've given up stupid posture decisions like working on a laptop late night on a couch! \n\nSo my questions for you:\n\n- Have you ever had such an issue? The whooshing and pounding the ears thing and associated symptoms?\n\n- Does this sound like a postural issue?\n\n- If so, can you recommend great yoga poses for combating this? What are the best stretches for neck, shoulder and upper back tension? I don't get pain as such, but lots of tension and pressure feeling.\n\nBtw, I'm an in-shape (and otherwise healthy) 34 year old man."

What kind of mat do you use, what are your recommendations to ensure grip and stability in your poses?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I purchased a Jade Harmony, will try to update with a review"

My flexibility and strength has definitely increased and my hip flexors have gained more flexibility as well, but for the past few months or so I have been experiencing what appears to be \"snapping hip syndrome\" which doesn't seem uncommon, but both hips snap pretty loudly now and it is getting to a point where I am experiencing pain in both hips from just walking/sitting/sleeping etc. I never used to feel pain when my hips snapped, but now it's pretty evident and a little concerning. I also figured that with regular yoga that it would help this condition and not worsen it. There have also been moments during certain postures or other activities where my hips \"lock up\" in pain, so I have to take it easy or stop...I can live in pigeon pose, but a yogi squat kills!\n\nDoes anyone have any experience or insight on this? Are there other exercises you would recommend, and if it's turning in to regular pain and discomfort, should I see a PT or is that unnecessary? Appreciate the time and insight, thanks!"

At first it started out great but eventually I started getting random annoying injuries and this has derailed my exercise routines. \n\nI started doing these exercises because I went to the docor with trouble sleeping and breathing and was diagnosed with depression?? \n\nHere's the kicker. I have some really flared ribs, but they're not flared because of muscle weakness or anything they're completely deformed. So as I'm looking into breathing exercises I noticed that it seems like I've always used my chest and shoulders to breath. So when I try to use my diaphram to breathe I get like half a full breath, maybe a little more.\n\nMy question to yogis is, can deformed ribs be the cause or affect of a dysfunctional diaphram? What sort of doc would I see to check this sort of thing out. \n\nIt's to the point where the orthopedic has me going to physical therapy for shoulder pain and I'm getting an mri on my shoulder but I don't think that is my issue. The np (still haven't actually seen the doctor because I'm pretty sure they just think I'm making this up) keeps telling me they can only treat pain but... It's not painful, I just can't breathe properly?? \n\nSo in practice have you seen any rib deformities impact the ability to breathe properly?"

However, looking at photos online I am actually seeing the lower hand being placed on the floor.\n\nSo, is extended side angle designed to be a stretch with the hand on the floor or a pose targeting the core with arms up in the air?\n\nI think this question can also apply to revolved triangle. Studio instructors at my local studio usually cue something like \"your lower arm/hand can be placed next to your front leg. Should I go ahead and place my hand on the floor in these poses if that is accessible to me?\n\nThanks for reading!"

For clarification, I’m not leading this class, just assisting students. I am teaching other classes tho. \n\nAnyway,  I want to know what your favorite hands on assists are. Which assists make you feel amazing? Are there any that you feel uncomfortable with? All experiences and opinions are welcome. \n\nOf course I’m looking at safety of the pose first. So checking for proper alignment and then diving a little deeper into the pose if the student wants to."

When I lead with my left foot however I don't seem to have any mental control over it and my body just kind of gets up there on its own.  With the latter it feels so confusing that I break the handstand because I don't feel like I have any control over my body.\n\nFor reference, I'm one of those weird people that writes with their right hand and bats with their left.  I'm also highly analytical from a mindset perspective."

If I know what words mean I kinda try to channel that internally (if that makes sense) but otherwise I just don’t feel comfortable repeating phrases when I don’t know what they mean. I’m not deep into the spiritual side of yoga, although I do love the focus on non judgment, honesty, acceptance, etc because I am a very anxious person. I’m very subtle about it and I do always bow my head and thank the teacher after class.\n\n2) Ladies wearing only sports bras on top. I don’t do heated classes but I sweat a ton. Normally I wouldn’t think twice but my studio clientele leans more toward middle aged women and nobody even shows midriff usually. Is it weird??"

      "reddit": "Sure, I can describe it.  Sorry if this is a bit long.  \n\nIn the vipassana retreat, I had a sort of breakthrough quasi-psychedelic experience on the 7th day (with a few smaller experiences in the days leading up to it, including lucid dreaming and hyperreal visual acuity).  It went something like this: without warning, I felt enveloped in a blue \"light\".  I was immersed in a profound (even supernatural) peace and happiness.  A ball of energy seemed to rise up from my perineum/crotch area and spread upwards to my head, seeming to gently force my head back and my mouth to open, as if this energy was exiting, or as if I was receiving something.  A large flower seemed to open up where I sat, stretching from my solar plexus to where my butt touched the floor (something I previously had thought was just a symbolic flourish in eastern religious art, but this seemed to be literally happening).  I ejaculated slightly without orgasming (sorry if that's a little gross or unwanted info).  I was flooded with the understanding that this is a state I or anyone else could experience at any moment, if we so chose, and we could all emerge from our suffering together.  Then the sit ended and the experience was over.\n\nA few years later, I was diagnosed with spinal arthritis, and in the midst of a total freakout, my wife encouraged me to meditate.  I had a full-blown experience, an absolutely ecstatic awakening of unitary consciousness, and a kind of filling up of my body with energy that was radiating from my belly and below.  It was a religio-mystical experience of remembering my true nature (it actually seemed like there was an intuition of a \"voice\" that asked me if I would \"like to remember\").  I was engulfed in all-encompassing love, compassion and forgiveness for everything that exists, and all the while my perception of self and reality seemed to fractal like a mandala.  There was no difference between what was inside and outside of me, eyes open or closed.  Physical pains, old grudges, and difficult memories that arose became gateways into deeper unfolding, and then the pains vanished. It was all love, and it was infinite and safe.\n\nThere was one thing that was particularly weird about this: while it was happening, every time my wife looked at me, she would kind of pass out.  She asked me why that was happening, and to my mind at the time, the answer was apparent; she was unconsciously attuning to my energy, but she was doing so in the way one ordinarily accesses this kind of dreamlike state: by sinking into sleep.  Also, when I spoke to her, my voice seemed to deepen, and I understood that when I typically talk with her (or anyone), it's like I am putting on a mask of personality that is perhaps flimsier than my \"true\" self.\n\nSince then, I've had regular experiences that are similar, but not usually (but sometimes) quite as laden with information; more typically, it's mostly a physical/energetic experience where it will rise up from my lower belly/perineum area and gently force my head back; I'll also go into at least a shallow trance where I may or may not have some insights.  I've become fairly adept at entering these states at will, and it will happen almost without fail during meditation and sometimes in yoga class.\n\nIt's been weird."

I understand others aren't looking at me but I cant help but feel like such a novice coming into a class where people can do so much and I'm like uncomfortable in chair pose. \n\nI dont know if this post is allowed or if this is the right sub. I guess just some positive mojo might help get me unstuck. I went to a yoga festival on Saturday and had such a good time outdoors meeting new people and doing yoga I want to bring that happiness into a class where I normally feel the opposite.\n\n\nThanks in advance ��✌��"

I have been doing the yoga with Adrian videos (30 days of yoga and then moved to Revolution), but now they are too easy! My body is craving something harder, does anyone of a yoga routine that maybe better suited for me. Im regaining muscle, it comes much easier than the 1st time. I am also doing sprinting every 3 days. Please and thank you! ��"

I love her style and I've watched all her videos multiple times. My first yoga practices were with Adriene, but I as started to learn, I needed more. I found Erin's channel and it was harder at the beginning, but I fell in love with her classes. She is focused on vinyasa yoga. The classes can be oriented around certain body parts (there is also a lot of strength building, never thought I would get nice sculpted arms, my male friends are impressed), or there are peak pose build up sessions. Furthermore they are often filmed in beautiful outdoor locations, in Costa Rica or Nicaragua.\n\nI am trying to support her as much as I can (already a patreon) and I hope she gets more subscribers."

      "reddit": "Hi all,\n\nFor a long time now, I've had an issue that I have put down to bad/inappropriate posture. \n\nUpon standing, I get a whooshing sound in my ears, like a raised pressure in both ears and the sound of blood pounding upwards. There's a marked increase in heart rate, too. It's not every day, but when it happens it's 99% of the time towards the end of the day.\n\nWith this, I get dizziness and sometimes a faint feeling – never fainted from it. When I'm having these issues, I'm always extremely tight around the neck, shoulders and upper back. At it's worst, it's accompanied by tension headaches.\n\nAs a small business owner, I sit and work long hours in-front of a computer screen. So I think this is the cause of my issue. I've been for multiple doctor checkups and had all sorts of tests done. Everything comes back fine.\n\nThis has been an issue for about 6 years now. It is sometimes worse and sometimes better. The times when it's better, I'm observing better posture, using a standing desk, doing yoga regularly, etc etc. And all the things you'd expect. It's also better after a shower (heat and muscle relaxing, I guess).\n\nOver the years, I've tried yoga, massage, acupuncture, myofascial release &amp; massage/lacrosse ball work, etc etc etc.\n\nI've given up stupid posture decisions like working on a laptop late night on a couch! \n\nSo my questions for you:\n\n- Have you ever had such an issue? The whooshing and pounding the ears thing and associated symptoms?\n\n- Does this sound like a postural issue?\n\n- If so, can you recommend great yoga poses for combating this? What are the best stretches for neck, shoulder and upper back tension? I don't get pain as such, but lots of tension and pressure feeling.\n\nBtw, I'm an in-shape (and otherwise healthy) 34 year old man."

When I try, for example, the ananda balasana i feel like a blade stuck in my hips.\n\nI've found on this sub a very interesting tutorial on how to address hamstrings tightness. Could you please help me release the other muscles as well?\n\nThank you."

Due to this hypermobility, I am not accustomed to having trouble accessing poses but the one that seems to have given me the most trouble over the years is seated wide angle posture. I am fine in seated forward fold and also in wide-leg forward fold (standing). However, when I move my legs into seated wide angle pose, I get an extremely intense sensation along the inner thighs even if my legs are at less than 90 degrees. Any ideas on what this could be a sign of? How to better release this tightness? One of my guesses is that it could be the inner thighs tightening to make up for the looseness of my hips... Any guidance or ideas welcome!"

I never made it in class but stayed afterwards and I did it twice and held 10-15 seconds each time. I broke my wrist 25 years ago and felt like I would never be able to do any crow poses.

I’m pretty sure I have some sort of disorder like hyperhidrosis or hyperthyroidism because I sweat profusely after even the smallest workout. I’ll be at the gym punching the heavy bag for 20 seconds and my clothes are literally soaked in sweat and my shoulders, face, and chest are glistening. Then I look around at the other people who have been training for longer and they haven’t even broken a sweat. So I guess my concern is, admittedly, what others will think of me during hot yoga. I know I shouldn’t care but I do. \n\nAre most people this sweaty during these? I also feel like the people who are going to hot yoga are generally people who are gonna be pretty open minded and non judgmental for the most part. Lemme know what you guys think!"

I stretch a little bit then i try again and again to build up the strength.\n\nMaybe I just need to be patient but i was hoping there would be strength building exercises off the mat that can help me hold the pose for longer because this has been very discouraging.\n\nAlso I have read many articles on the topic and many youtube videos, but all of these are “on the mat” stretches and exercises. The only thing that makes my forearms actually burn is when i’m trying to hold correct wrist form...but again after a month i can still only hold it for like 45 seconds in tabletop. Can’t even do plank or downward dog :(  \n\nanyone been through this before? Any tips to build up strength because i don’t think my current routine is working."

I can only hold both for about 20-30 seconds before my hands hurt and I am shaking. There aren’t really any modifications to these that I have found. I am trying to power through it to better myself later on. Another thing I have noticed is that I am sweating and panting near the end of the video. Is this bad? Am I disrespecting the yoga culture by not being able to breathe correctly at the end?"

I was extremely let down and felt it was very dangerous, nothing like any of my previous yoga experiences. I had no idea about the controversy surrounding Bikram yoga until I searched if it was safe or even a \"real\" yoga form (loosely used, I'm not an elitist; it just felt so different than other yoga types). There was no flow, and you keep going from savasana to all these other poses which is extremely unnatural. I kept getting light headed and dizzy because there was no time for me to grab a drink (this may or may not be the instructor's timing, though). It was not focused on grounding you in the moment or appreciating and caring for your body. We were repeatedly told to lock our knees and force our knees down, and to push our body as far as we could, which I have never experienced before. It was 90 miserable minutes where I couldnt get my feet grounded or hold poses because of how wet I was. What are everyone's thoughts on Bikram Yoga?"

I was wondering if anyone had any tips on specific muscles to engage to combat turnout, specifically in locust pose. \n\nAs soon as I start to rise into locust my hips automatically turn out and even when I'm focusing on lifting from my hamstrings, my glutes/inner thighs take over. What muscles should I focus on activating here so i'm doing the pose correctly? As a note, I'm also very hypermobile in my hips, shoulders, elbows, etc.\n\nThank you!"

For instance, I can quite easly grab my hands behind the back (as in gomukasana) but after a week of shoulder opening exercises it feels much harder and painful! \n\nI don't do particularly hard shoulders opening exercises (pretty much standard stuff) and I don't get that kind of \"rebound\" sensation in any other joints, that I usually push much harder.\n\nHas anyone experience something like that? is it something specific to the shoulder joints or just me...?  \n\nMany thanks!"

Do you have a set series of poses like ashtanga?  Thank you in advance for any answers.  Additional question for RYT’s, does your method of a self guided practice differ from how you create a practice for a class?  Thanks again and Namaste!"

Im likely going to be in this house for a little while (but less than a year), and yoga keeps me sane, so I don't mind investing some money."

How can you become a certified yoga instructor from an online course? I'm a big fan of online learning - I've done many courses through universities, Udemy, and other websites. But I can't help feeling some human interaction is required to become a yoga instructor - some hands-on interactions with other people. How are you meant to teach adjustments via a computer / video!\n\nTo me these kinds of programs are dangerous, and devalue regular yoga teacher training. And I don't care if you've got a PH.d!"

I used to do yoga every day and it really helped me with chronic stress and back pain, then I started wrist pain and I realized i had incorrect wrist form.\n\nNow it’s been over a month of spending time on the mat in a simple tabletop position doing wrist stretches that i’ve found, then trying to bare weight on my wrists, and this lasts only about 45 seconds in proper form and I have to stop because my forearms burn so bad. I stretch a little bit then i try again and again to build up the strength.\n\nMaybe I just need to be patient but i was hoping there would be strength building exercises off the mat that can help me hold the pose for longer because this has been very discouraging.\n\nAlso I have read many articles on the topic and many youtube videos, but all of these are “on the mat” stretches and exercises. The only thing that makes my forearms actually burn is when i’m trying to hold correct wrist form...but again after a month i can still only hold it for like 45 seconds in tabletop. Can’t even do plank or downward dog :(  \n\nanyone been through this before? Any tips to build up strength because i don’t think my current routine is working."

But I don't know if it's because my flexibility needs some work (I'm moderately flexible) or my body proportions are off (torso on the shorter side, with longer legs). I know I have the core strength to do it. Honestly it feels like my legs are too long or something. I figure if it really is my body proportions, then it likely won't ever be possible for me and I don't want to waste the effort. But if it's a simple fix, I'd love to hear some advice!

      "reddit": "I'm late to the party, but wanted to throw my two cents in.\n\nI primarily do hot yoga and it is just *so* awesome! Here are my necessities:\n\n* Yoga towel (some ppl use a regular towel) over your yoga mat. This is essential, otherwise you will slip and slide all over your mat.\n\n* My studio offers a basket of hand-towels to use. This super helpful! I keep a hand towel at the head of my mat so that I can grab it while in forward fold to quickly wipe my face/arms when needed.\n\n* I'm always surprised people don't mention a head-band for hot yoga. I have to wear a headband on my forehead to 1) keep hair back and, more importantly, 2) to keep sweat out of my eyes! Bonus points if it is a wide headband so you can cover your ears if needed. I will pull my headband over my ears at the end of class during floor work (i.e., bridge, savasana, etc) to keep sweat out of my ears!\n\n* I don't know if you are male or female, but I personally recommend long yoga pants opposed to shorts. I find I need the friction of the pants to hold any arm balances; otherwise my legs slip off my triceps with shorts on.\n\nKeep in mind, your first time in a hot yoga class can feel overwhelming with the heat. Take it easy and rest in savasana if you feel the need. It might take several classes for you to get used to working out in a heated room. Also, I don't recommend eating before class. I intentionally attend hot yoga classes on an empty stomach, otherwise I might get nausea or experience heartburn. With that in mind, I also do not attempt to hydrate *during* a hot yoga class. Hydrate before or after class! \n\nAnother tip: be careful about over-stretching in a hot yoga class. Typically, you can go deeper into poses in a hot yoga class, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea. Listen to your body. Injuries can happen if you overdo it in stretching poses! (speaking from experience, unfortunately!)\n\nAs an aside- I also sweat profusely. Even my forearms will be dripping sweat during class and I will look around and see that no one else's forearms are sweaty. haha! It's cool though. Embrace the heat, embrace the sweat, and you will learn to LOVE it!"

I feel like I need more help specifically with what direction my hips should be facing and what to do with my shoulders (since these areas of my body seem to just do what they want.) I love classes but I’m not getting that level of instruction there either. Signed up for some beginner Iyengar classes that I hope will be more helpful.

Woke up did my yoga practices basic yogaasanas,  sun salutation (Surya Kriya) and kriya breathing practices.\n\nWierd thing is that :\n\n1. When practicing certain postures there are sudden jerk of moments, sometimes in the stomach region but there are very obvious moments that is like I am doing a **penetration action** (FUCKING ACTION) that are involuntary.\n2. Secondly, I am very energetic calm and composed when practicing yoga but right after yoga when I start studying. There is a huge erection and I become lazy and tired. Then I go and lay on the bed still with erection on, I feel my body is trying to flush out the semen forcefully it is looking for ways to push out. Then after 30 mins or so I am back to normal.\n\nAdditional information :- while doing the postures **I breathe through my nose**, if lack of sleep was the problem but I feel refreshed and energetic while doing my yoga.. I am on strict **monk mode**, **vegan** diet + **no junk mentally** \\+ **noSurf**. It is my 60th day on noFap. This is happening for a quite sometime now."

I feel like maybe I need to round my back out first (like in cat pose), before transitioning. It's moving while it's scooped (like in cow pose) that seems to put strain on my back. But again, it's hard to do this in one breath and feels awkward."

I’m working my way back to my practice, and am going through the growing pains of building up strength, endurance and flexibility again.\n\nI’m finding it incredibly challenging to do any lower body based asanas. A standing forward fold burns, and I cannot straighten my legs entirely. Seated forward fold always needs a bolster under my knees. Laying on my back with my legs up, whether one or both of them, using a strap, my leg(s) vibrate to the point I cannot hold them up, and once again I cannot straighten even with the extension of a strap.\n\nI don’t know how to approach this. Don’t push myself as hard? Is it my hams or quads causing the restriction? Is my core weak?  All of the above, and if so if I power through with a balanced practice and one day mm by mm I’ll get more comfortable?\n\nI know a part of this is striving, as I admire yogis who can seemingly just flatten there legs to the ground and fold over them, so I’m working on meeting myself where I am. \n\nHas anyone had similar experiences or advice on where to focus?"

I stopped yoga to recuperate mentally/emotionally from this injury but have returned to the practice at a much lower intensity despite not having resolved the injury. Should I do postures on the healthy side that I can no longer do on the other side? Or should I stick to only doing postures that are accessible on both sides? Why/why not?\n\nI have accepted that my right quad will begin to atrophy, although I can still do some work to maintain hamstring/glute strength. The typical ways we might strengthen the left quad in yoga (various warrior/lunge postures) are not accessible because they place the right knee in a vulnerable position. However, bodyweight exercises like one legged pistol squat are still doable for left leg. Is there any reason not to continue to strengthen this other leg other?"

I was experiencing acute shoulder pain elsewhere before). My DD now resembles the second pic here (of another yogi redditor):\n\nhttps://imgur.com/zriFAK9\n\nHOWEVER. I cannot stop experiencing pain in my left deltoid -- pretty much the area between the bicep and tricep. It's ONLY the left one, and it's only when my practice includes downward dog. The pain is a dull, bothersome ache and is very tender to massage. Pain flares after doing a few DDs. An instructor said this was probably because I was engaging new muscle groups and it would go away in time. It's been about 3-4 months of 1-4x/weekly practice and continues to be a problem. The pain goes away within 2-3 days of no DD.\n\nMy left shoulder IS less mobile than my right, but not absurdly so.  Any ideas?"

The Universe was clearly trying to tell me something. \n\nSo I was there, yoga-ing with some incredibly physically beautiful people and normal type people. As I looked closer, respectfully, I realized I could see all the flaws, “wobbly bits”, some incredible tattoo inking, and folds of skin. I saw my reflection and was disgusted with the “chunky monkey” looking back at me. \n\nBut here’s the kicker....\n\nI realized that I’m a beautiful person too!! Sure I’m a little overweight, stressed out at times dealing with my Nex-SO, but by being true to myself  it makes me a beautiful person who has a right to be with positive people. \n\nSo to all of you who are going through these tough times, stay beautiful!!\n\n\n...and do yoga!"

If a pose either isn't in your practice, or if you're just not feeling it that day, do whatever feels best.  The other practitioners around you are focused on their own practice, so don't feel self-conscious about that either.\n\nIf you somehow have the misfortune of visiting a studio that isn't giving you positive, healthy vibes, find one that does.  Lord knows there are plenty around.\n\nOne final note on mirrors.  Mirrors in studios are really important for helping us modify and improve our positioning and alignment.  An instructor might say something (e.g., \"make sure your shoulders are back and you're standing with a straight back\").  You may think that you're doing that, but years of bad posture (me) have left you unaware of how you actually stand.  I realize that the association we have with mirrors is largely based around vanity, but the mirrors in yoga studios are primarily about function.  Use them with that mindset to work on and improving your practice. \n\nGood luck.  You'll love it."

Basically he would carefully drape a warm towel over the part of your body he would touch -- back, shoulders, hips, etc. Then he would do the adjustments and massage type things over that. The only time I remember him not using a towel was when he did temple or forehead massages during Savasana. It was soothing to have that warm and soft towel draped over you, and his adjustments were always so strong and firm. He also told me that the towel helped him to stabilize himself when someone was sweaty and he needed to touch bare skin, meaning that he could be just as firm on slippery skin as on clothed or dry skin. Great stuff."

      "reddit": "Let me share my experience of staying at Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore for 2 weeks. My experience there was very weird and it is hard to explain what I feel here. \n\nI was a big fan of Sadhguru and watched a lot of his Videos and read his book. I also practiced his Aum Kara and Isha Kriya and really liked the effects I got from it...\n\nSo I had very big expectations when I came to Isha Center at Coimbatore for Guru purnima celebration...\n\nI have been staying at Isha for over 2 weeks now... during this time I saw Sadhguru live 2 times and I also attended his Inner Engineering Program. \n\nWhen I first arrived at the Center I could immediately feel a strong energy. Within minutes it is like all your stress and worries are taken away, you feel a certain peace...\nWhen I went to the Dyanalinga I could feel it vibrating in my chakras, especially the heart, throut and eyebrowcenter, also my head went automatically up to the tip of the lingam. It is like a magnetic pull... So I sat there very peaceful and very thoughtless for over an hour...\n\nThe first days here I was quite amazed by this strong energy and I thought I found the best place ever.\n\nBut the first weird thing that happend, was the connection with my girlfriend who was with me at the ashram. Somehow we couldn't communicate properly. It was like something was blocking our relationship. It is like sadhguru doesn't allow you to be here as a couple!!!\n\nWhen the IE Program started, I felt even weirder. The whole Program felt like a brainwash to me... \n\nAfter the program I volinteered here for a week. I saw under what terrible conditions the people live here. Some are sleeping on the floor, getting 2 meels per day working 8-9 hours a day, 7 days a week, without payment!!!\nAnd people here are not happy. They are not Joyful. It is not the way sadhguru describes it. People outside the ashram in the city look more joyful.\n\nNow after observing clearly I understand the energy here... It is not the pure divine energy it is supposed to be. It is highly programmed. It controlles the way you think and feel. It somehow enslaves you to behave and do what sadhguru wants you to do and think. For example you cannot think In sex here. It is not possible... But you also cannot judge properly. You are not questioning...\nEverybody here is blindly following sadhguru and repeating his words like robots... \n\nLet me tell you the weirdest thing... There was a day when Sadhguru got sick in Australia. He posted that on Instagram. And the next day everybody was little sick at the ashram!!! My girlfriend told me that during the day she heard that sound, this noise sadhguru makes when he iniciates all the time...\nWhat if sadhguru uses his people as a battery??\nLike a big energyfield out of his followers for his own purpose???\nThis is just a theory of course...\n\nBut fact is that the energy in this place controlls you in a strong way and nobody here seems to be aware of that... I don't see the people here free or joyfully. It lookes like an exchange. You get some kind of peace and this \"everything is ok\" kind of feeling, but you exchange it for your possibility to think and akt for yourself. I see some people here very, very deluted. Especially the people that are staying here long-term seem to be completely enslaved...\n\nSo I ask myself what is the purpose of all this??? What is sadhgurus real plan?? Wellbeing for humanity??\nDoesn't look like that to me\n\nThis is my experience with Isha...\nEverybody seems to be super happy with this place...\nAm I the only one who sees things like that???"

I have seen people say that when you are starting out with yoga you have to be weary of your wrists so I am posing the question of, is starting yoga worth it for me given the wrist issues?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLook forward to hearing responses and thanks in advance!"

Now that I'm using my diaphram I'm pretty sure all the muscles I WAS using are now loosening up and it feels painful/relieving. I'm really just looking for any info or experience with this.\n\nI've also been trying to increase flexibility in my spine and intercostals where I can. \n\nThis has come with some very strange head rushes and my vision even seems to randomly get better, but noticibly so. \n\nBy doing yoga and stretches and what not can you unlock ribs bones and nerves that could be causing this?\n\nThanks for any advice tips or pointers!"

I had totally overlooked this pose because it did not offer any challenge and just seemed too basic. Boy was I wrong, totalling two hours of it a day really does calm my general body nervousity around my occipital pain, which I interpret as calming my nervous system / stimulating the rest and relax system in the most efficient way I have ever found.\n\nHence my curiosity and questions in the title."

It was likely composed in the Bengal region of India, the same region that houses Kolkata and Ghosh's College. This text was available in Bengali, a regional language spoken by ordinary people, as opposed to the sacred Sanskrit, so it had an outsized impact on yoga's development in the last few hundred years.\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;The last few chapters of the Gheranda Samhita cover topics that have largely been lost to modern western iterations of yoga. Admittedly, they are often difficult and require significant effort and persistence. In Ghosh's lineage, the practice of pranayama has been whittled down to Kapalbhati, with Sitali offered to some advanced students. Mudras and Pratyahara are more advanced still.\n\nhttps://www.yogapoint.com/info/kapalbhati.htm\n\n\n&gt; REFERENCES IN THE ANCIENT TEXTS\n\n&gt; Gherandsamhita describes Kapalbhati in its first chapter. Gherandsamhitakar state while describing the three types of Kapalbhati :\n&gt; \n&gt; G S 1.54\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; There are three types of Kapalbhati - Vatkrama, Vyutkrama and Sheetkram. By performing kapalbhati doshas of kapha are eliminated.\n&gt; The next shloka describes Vatkram Kapalbhati.\n&gt; \n&gt; G S 1.55\n&gt; \n&gt; The air should be inhaled with Ida Nadi ( left nostril ) and exhaled through Pingala Nadi ( right nostril ). Again the process should be performed in a reverse manner.\n&gt; \n&gt; G S 1.56\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Pooraka and Rechaka should be performed rapidly, without performing Kumbhaka. This eliminates kapha doshas.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then Vyutkrama and Sheetkrama Kapalbhatis are described. However, we will see them under the chapter Neti.\n&gt; \n&gt; The process of Kapalbhati that we have studied so far is different from that stated in Gherandsamhita. Hathapradeepikakars have described Kapalbhati in a more correct manner.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2-35\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; When Pooraka and Rechaka are performed rapidly as in bellows of a blacksmith. It is known as Kapalbhati. The study of Kapalbhati reduces kapha doshas.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both Gherandsamhita and Hathapradeepikakars agree that the practice of Kapalbhati eliminates kapha doshas. Hathapradeepikakar describes the process in detail. And the simile used by them is very apt in the sense that if one observes the movement of the bellows, the fan is pressed to release the air out with force and then loosened to let the air in with natural ease. Similarly, a forceful rechaka and natural pooraka with rapid movement is expected in Kapalbhati. Hence, the description by Hathapradeepikakar is more proper and clear than that given by Gherandsamhita and is more in vogue.\n&gt; \n\n---\n\nSo we know its at least 300 years old. but Do we know how old it really is ?\n\nBonus questions do you think that everyday breathing should be \n\n- gentle or forced?\n- silent or audible?\n- nose or mouth?\n- diaphragmatic or belly?\n- small or big?\n- slow or fast?\n- deep or shallow?"

      "reddit": "Hello yogis.\n\nSo, I've posted a few times here for advice as I grow my personal practice and the community has been wonderful, so here I am again!\n\nMy hamstrings are insanely tight. Not like \"Oh my hammies need a little extra stretch today.\". Like \"I can't sit up with my legs extended without arching my back. Like, at all.\" Can't touch my toes, can't flat back, etc.\n\nIn a previous post, a teacher asked how my low back was feeling during my forward fold. Well, my back always tingles/is sore after my practice but I figured that was a natural asect of movement. Yesterday, I did my routine with no forward folds/tabletops and my back didn't hurt. It was still \"open\" but the specific pain sensation in my lower back wasn't there, which means I'm so tight, I can't even do micro forward bends without immediately jacking up my low back. So, two questions:\n\n1. I was using forward fold to try to legntehn my hamstrings, but I feel like I'm doing more damage to my low back than I am doing good to my hamstrings in that position. The only hamstring opener I've found that doesnt hurt my low back is down dog with knees heavily heavily bent (basically in a spider stance.). Are there any other poses I should be looking at that could stretch my hamstrings without putting pressure on my low back? (I can't do seated postures with legs extended, and I tried feet up the wall put it made my calves hurt and for some reasons I started getting twinges with my achilles.) Or, should I just stick to foam rolling until I undo some damage?\n\n2. I like doing guided vinyassa videos in the evening. What should I do when they say \"forward fold/flat back.\"? Should I just stand up? Should squat down and fully collapse over my knees with my back rounded? Should I only go down an inch or two forward, which is about as far as I can go maintaing a flat back and I'm not joking there. For flat back should I go all the way down into almost a crow pose and hang out there? What are my options or suggestions?\n\nThank you in advance! Namaste!"

Feet rooted down, thighs and glutes engaged, calves slightly externally rotated, shoulders back, chest open, navel pulled to spine to puff out middle back. Try to use your core to pull your back to touch the wall without rounding your shoulders. \n\n It's like the simplest but hardest thing, but that mechanic of pulling in your core will strengthen your inversion whether it's a head stand or handstand :)"

I've noticed that:\n\n-My upper left side is more flexible than my upper right side\n\n-My lower left side is less flexible than my lower right side\n\n-My balance and lower body strength are about the same on both feet\n\nMost interesting however is when I kick up for a handstand, when I lead with my right foot I feel like it's very controlled and there's a lot of thought behind the movement.  When I lead with my left foot however I don't seem to have any mental control over it and my body just kind of gets up there on its own.  With the latter it feels so confusing that I break the handstand because I don't feel like I have any control over my body.\n\nFor reference, I'm one of those weird people that writes with their right hand and bats with their left.  I'm also highly analytical from a mindset perspective."

I work 12 hour shifts, lift weights 4-6 days a week, train BJJ 3-4 days a week and I take long dog walks as often as possible.  I don't have time for a whole yoga class. I've been using [www.yogaforbjj.com](https://www.yogaforbjj.com) for a few weeks now and it was exactly what I needed... until it wasn't. I already lift and train hard, I don't have it in me to be doing the more aggressive calisthenic type stuff that the instructor was getting in to. I try and get the flow in after lifting, so lots of core and push-up type work is too much, my arms/legs/core are already exhausted.\n\nI'm hoping to find a 10-15 minute flow to work on my mobility, ideally something with some thoracic spine work (updogs, etc) and some hip openers (like pigeon). Something that I can do (almost) every day to help improve my movement, posture, etc. I have no urge to become a yoga practitioner, I just find the Vinyasa style stuff does wonders for movement and range of motion.\n\nSo, have you stumbled across anything like this? I don't mind paying for it if it is what I'm looking for."

I want to improve my flexibility for injury prevention and martial arts. So just wondering is it still possible for a 16 year old to start stretching and become flexible or age has nothing to do with it?\n\nanyways i'd like to improve leg flexibility specifically, wanna be able to do the splits and kick high. I stretch on average about 45-60 minutes a day (just started yesterday) while holding each stretch for a minute. Will that be enough or will i need to stretch more?\n\nthe thing is i already go to a gym regularly and has gained pretty decent strength and some muscle mass at least for a 16 yr old. I'm wondering is gaining flexibility harder than gaining strength or is it about the same difficulty? Cuz I'm thinking to myself if i can get decent strength then i should be able to become flexible lol\n\nanyways yea, just ANY advice is welcome, i've been avoiding this problem for a while now but now i really want to get flexible, thanks"

I dont care for the whole instagram yoga scene, but its a helpful platform to keep me up to date with class times/ knowing if the teacher will be away so perhaps I can try a new class that week. I lived in a smaller city and I became good friends with one of the teachers and she gave me leaving gifts when I moved, I went to her for years and don't remotely find this odd bc of the basis of our friendship and also he professionalism.\n\nI moved to a very big city, found my classes and have been going to them around year now. One class I really liked bc the teacher was very hands on and always pushing me deeper or teaching me the next progressional pose. After a year, he started DMing me after class to say how good my practice was, I didnt think much bc I was injured and thought he was just being encouraging. However this has progressed to him liking and commenting on all my photos (normally with that heart eye emoji) and stories and has said im beautiful. (I have not replied to any of these)\n\nedit- i also want to add he's just said some bizzare things in my DMs about his ex wife and stuff. I have never had a conversation with him in the studio that was more than a hello or letting him now about an injury\n\nIve been away on holiday, but now I don't want to go to his class. I dont even know if I should say anything to someone at the studio as this has taken place outside the studio. But Im generally just really annoyed and what I thought was a safe space, and now i can't go. It makes me think back on all the adjustments and times this man has touched me, and I was in a class today (diff instructor) and I really didn't like the adjustments or general closeness. \n\nI feel like it has ruined it a bit for me, because I love hands on teachers. Am I over reacting? Should I say something to the studio. I can't tell. How would you feel about it?"

I had totally overlooked this pose because it did not offer any challenge and just seemed too basic. Boy was I wrong, totalling two hours of it a day really does calm my general body nervousity around my occipital pain, which I interpret as calming my nervous system / stimulating the rest and relax system in the most efficient way I have ever found.\n\nHence my curiosity and questions in the title."

I dont care for the whole instagram yoga scene, but its a helpful platform to keep me up to date with class times/ knowing if the teacher will be away so perhaps I can try a new class that week. I lived in a smaller city and I became good friends with one of the teachers and she gave me leaving gifts when I moved, I went to her for years and don't remotely find this odd bc of the basis of our friendship and also he professionalism.\n\nI moved to a very big city, found my classes and have been going to them around year now. One class I really liked bc the teacher was very hands on and always pushing me deeper or teaching me the next progressional pose. After a year, he started DMing me after class to say how good my practice was, I didnt think much bc I was injured and thought he was just being encouraging. However this has progressed to him liking and commenting on all my photos (normally with that heart eye emoji) and stories and has said im beautiful. (I have not replied to any of these)\n\nedit- i also want to add he's just said some bizzare things in my DMs about his ex wife and stuff. I have never had a conversation with him in the studio that was more than a hello or letting him now about an injury\n\nIve been away on holiday, but now I don't want to go to his class. I dont even know if I should say anything to someone at the studio as this has taken place outside the studio. But Im generally just really annoyed and what I thought was a safe space, and now i can't go. It makes me think back on all the adjustments and times this man has touched me, and I was in a class today (diff instructor) and I really didn't like the adjustments or general closeness. \n\nI feel like it has ruined it a bit for me, because I love hands on teachers. Am I over reacting? Should I say something to the studio. I can't tell. How would you feel about it?"

Studios can only stay alive it seems by offering all these workout-focused classes that are hot and fast with loud music, and majority of people like that! How can we get back to the beautiful simplicity of the teachings, while still (as studios and teachers) stay alive? Thoughts on this?"

I’m pretty sure I have some sort of disorder like hyperhidrosis or hyperthyroidism because I sweat profusely after even the smallest workout. I’ll be at the gym punching the heavy bag for 20 seconds and my clothes are literally soaked in sweat and my shoulders, face, and chest are glistening. Then I look around at the other people who have been training for longer and they haven’t even broken a sweat. So I guess my concern is, admittedly, what others will think of me during hot yoga. I know I shouldn’t care but I do. \n\nAre most people this sweaty during these? I also feel like the people who are going to hot yoga are generally people who are gonna be pretty open minded and non judgmental for the most part. Lemme know what you guys think!"

Last year, my favorite teacher announced that she was moving, and recommended me for teacher training, and I said yes. I now teach 2 beginner level classes and am considered a teacher in training. \n\nNow that my favorite teacher has moved, I have been attending the studio owner’s classes and training under her. Let’s call her Stacey. \n\nI had attended Stacey’s classes before my favorite teacher moved, and while she wasn’t particularly friendly, she was knowledgeable and her classes were good. \n\nTraining under Stacey has been absolutely awful. She actually yells at me in class, in front of students, if I am doing the poses wrong. Sometimes she will ask me to assist her while she is teaching, and has yelled at me if I’m not assisting correctly to the point it makes me cry. She uses embarrassment to correct me, like if I have the wrong arm position, she will stand next to me and tap her foot and sigh until I figure out what I’m doing wrong. She has slapped me on the back once while making an “adjustment” and pushed me out of Vrksasana once during a teacher training exercise. \n\nIn the past year, she has had several teachers quit including my favorite teacher that moved, which makes me believe I’m not the only one that doesn’t like working with her. However, she does have one other teacher that has been with the studio long term, and I wonder how she does it? \n\nI reached out to my favorite teacher and told her what was going on, and she said “yeah she treated me that way too. She’s hard on you because she likes you.”\n\nI’m trying to figure out what to do. I have a day job that supports me financially. This was supposed to be for fun. It’s not fun. I actually like teaching yoga but find it a little overwhelming to do with my day job (45 hours per week). \n\nThis is my dilemma. I love the style of yoga I do, and there isn’t another studio nearby with this style. I like my yoga friends, and would miss them if I left. I am thinking of just trying out taking classes at other studios nearby to see how it is, and if I find a good match, then resign. The only thing is, it’s a small town and a lot of students at my studio attend at other studios too, so others would know if I’m trying out other studios. \n\nI have thought about sticking it out until I move in about 5 years, but I don’t know if my mental health can take it. I like teaching yoga but would prefer to be a student first. \n\nAlso, if anyone has advice on resigning as a yoga teacher, I would love to hear it. \n\nTl;dr my yoga boss is a bully, but I like this style of yoga and miss my favorite teacher. I would also love advice on how to resign as a yoga teacher."

Like I don't know why, but the slow burn of yoga is so much better than any high impact workout that I've done and now I find myself doing yoga every day and not wanting to do any other workout.\n\nFor some reason I feel bad, like this isn't doing enough to tone/build muscle.\n\nI just don't know how to go back to strength."

When I do shavasana, my lower back arches a lot and my lower back can’t really get comfortable. I also have a bit of weird posture. \n\nWhat are some stretches I can do to help with this??"

I was wondering if anyone had any tips on specific muscles to engage to combat turnout, specifically in locust pose. \n\nAs soon as I start to rise into locust my hips automatically turn out and even when I'm focusing on lifting from my hamstrings, my glutes/inner thighs take over. What muscles should I focus on activating here so i'm doing the pose correctly? As a note, I'm also very hypermobile in my hips, shoulders, elbows, etc.\n\nThank you!"

Crow, Side crow, Eight angle, Flying pigeon, Grasshopper Firefly... but these two just feel totally out of my league!\n\nIt is quite surprising to me because after firstly learning crow, I could usually get the \"hang\"/ \"feel\" of other arm balance poses and then practise it until I can hold it. But these two somehow feel like a total leap of skill. I'm crashing every day which is quite discouraging.\n\nFor those who have mastered the poses, how did you get there?  \nAre there some poses I should be learning in between? Or a particular muscle group I should be focusing on? \n\nThank You!"

I got almost halfway through the 35? week sequence in Iyengar's Light on Yoga, but gave it up after reading The Science of Yoga and a few articles that suggested a lot of the poses don't really have any actual benefits and can cause harm. I want to know, where can I learn (mainly looking for books) more about yoga/stretching from an unbiased scientific/anatomical perspective? I don't care for the \"spiritual\" side of yoga, although I do enjoy the calming effect it has on my mind. Ultimately, I just want something that is going to help me stretch my muscles and improve my posture."

When practicing certain postures there are sudden jerk of moments, sometimes in the stomach region but there are very obvious moments that is like I am doing a **penetration action** (FUCKING ACTION) that are involuntary.\n2. Secondly, I am very energetic calm and composed when practicing yoga but right after yoga when I start studying. There is a huge erection and I become lazy and tired. Then I go and lay on the bed still with erection on, I feel my body is trying to flush out the semen forcefully it is looking for ways to push out. Then after 30 mins or so I am back to normal.\n\nAdditional information :- while doing the postures **I breathe through my nose**, if lack of sleep was the problem but I feel refreshed and energetic while doing my yoga.. I am on strict **monk mode**, **vegan** diet + **no junk mentally** \\+ **noSurf**. It is my 60th day on noFap. This is happening for a quite sometime now."

My experience there was very weird and it is hard to explain what I feel here. \n\nI was a big fan of Sadhguru and watched a lot of his Videos and read his book. I also practiced his Aum Kara and Isha Kriya and really liked the effects I got from it...\n\nSo I had very big expectations when I came to Isha Center at Coimbatore for Guru purnima celebration...\n\nI have been staying at Isha for over 2 weeks now... during this time I saw Sadhguru live 2 times and I also attended his Inner Engineering Program. \n\nWhen I first arrived at the Center I could immediately feel a strong energy. Within minutes it is like all your stress and worries are taken away, you feel a certain peace...\nWhen I went to the Dyanalinga I could feel it vibrating in my chakras, especially the heart, throut and eyebrowcenter, also my head went automatically up to the tip of the lingam. It is like a magnetic pull... So I sat there very peaceful and very thoughtless for over an hour...\n\nThe first days here I was quite amazed by this strong energy and I thought I found the best place ever.\n\nBut the first weird thing that happend, was the connection with my girlfriend who was with me at the ashram. Somehow we couldn't communicate properly. It was like something was blocking our relationship. It is like sadhguru doesn't allow you to be here as a couple!!!\n\nWhen the IE Program started, I felt even weirder. The whole Program felt like a brainwash to me... \n\nAfter the program I volinteered here for a week. I saw under what terrible conditions the people live here. Some are sleeping on the floor, getting 2 meels per day working 8-9 hours a day, 7 days a week, without payment!!!\nAnd people here are not happy. They are not Joyful. It is not the way sadhguru describes it. People outside the ashram in the city look more joyful.\n\nNow after observing clearly I understand the energy here... It is not the pure divine energy it is supposed to be. It is highly programmed. It controlles the way you think and feel. It somehow enslaves you to behave and do what sadhguru wants you to do and think. For example you cannot think In sex here. It is not possible... But you also cannot judge properly. You are not questioning...\nEverybody here is blindly following sadhguru and repeating his words like robots... \n\nLet me tell you the weirdest thing... There was a day when Sadhguru got sick in Australia. He posted that on Instagram. And the next day everybody was little sick at the ashram!!! My girlfriend told me that during the day she heard that sound, this noise sadhguru makes when he iniciates all the time...\nWhat if sadhguru uses his people as a battery??\nLike a big energyfield out of his followers for his own purpose???\nThis is just a theory of course...\n\nBut fact is that the energy in this place controlls you in a strong way and nobody here seems to be aware of that... I don't see the people here free or joyfully. It lookes like an exchange. You get some kind of peace and this \"everything is ok\" kind of feeling, but you exchange it for your possibility to think and akt for yourself. I see some people here very, very deluted. Especially the people that are staying here long-term seem to be completely enslaved...\n\nSo I ask myself what is the purpose of all this??? What is sadhgurus real plan?? Wellbeing for humanity??\nDoesn't look like that to me\n\nThis is my experience with Isha...\nEverybody seems to be super happy with this place...\nAm I the only one who sees things like that???"

I think my hamstrings are ok (not the greatest) now, and I can reach the floor now, but my tummy really does not touch my thigh that well when I fold, there is a big gap between them even if I suck in as much as I can. My thinking is that to forward bend, you need to get that space between your tummy and thighs closer to each other too? So do you forward fold with a slight bend in your knee to get them closer with time?"

Not like \"Oh my hammies need a little extra stretch today.\". Like \"I can't sit up with my legs extended without arching my back. Like, at all.\" Can't touch my toes, can't flat back, etc.\n\nIn a previous post, a teacher asked how my low back was feeling during my forward fold. Well, my back always tingles/is sore after my practice but I figured that was a natural asect of movement. Yesterday, I did my routine with no forward folds/tabletops and my back didn't hurt. It was still \"open\" but the specific pain sensation in my lower back wasn't there, which means I'm so tight, I can't even do micro forward bends without immediately jacking up my low back. So, two questions:\n\n1. I was using forward fold to try to legntehn my hamstrings, but I feel like I'm doing more damage to my low back than I am doing good to my hamstrings in that position. The only hamstring opener I've found that doesnt hurt my low back is down dog with knees heavily heavily bent (basically in a spider stance.). Are there any other poses I should be looking at that could stretch my hamstrings without putting pressure on my low back? (I can't do seated postures with legs extended, and I tried feet up the wall put it made my calves hurt and for some reasons I started getting twinges with my achilles.) Or, should I just stick to foam rolling until I undo some damage?\n\n2. I like doing guided vinyassa videos in the evening. What should I do when they say \"forward fold/flat back.\"? Should I just stand up? Should squat down and fully collapse over my knees with my back rounded? Should I only go down an inch or two forward, which is about as far as I can go maintaing a flat back and I'm not joking there. For flat back should I go all the way down into almost a crow pose and hang out there? What are my options or suggestions?\n\nThank you in advance! Namaste!"

I'm currently 2 days into a 30 day challenge by yoga with Adrienne but would like to get some in class training too. A studio close to my house offers a beginners drop in on sundays, some fundamental classes, and a all levels class every day (fits my schedule best). Will I feel out of place or be left in the dust during the All Levels? Is the 30 day challenge enough? Am I over thinking all of this? Any of your thoughts would be appreciated."

Due to some mental health issues and a medication change, I gained 60 lbs over the course of about a year and a half, which I am now working to get off via diet and exercise. \n\nI really miss yoga and would like to get back to it, so I’ve started the 30 days of Yoga with Adrienne. As much as I like her, and feel better overall after a practice, OH DEAR GOD are some things uncomfortable, to the point of pain- my knees hurt in cat/cow, my freaking butt bones hurt in boat. While I truly believe plus sized women can do yoga and kick ass at it, at this point that extra sixty lbs feels like it’s killing me! I should mention too that this extra weight puts me in the BMI category of obese- a size 16-18 at 5’5. On my frame it is very uncomfortable and as stated, it is something I’m working on to better my health. In the meantime though- does anyone have any suggestions? Practicing on a thicker mat didn’t seem to make a difference. Am I resigned to avoiding these poses until I can reduce the strain on my joints by losing some of this weight?"

I have to hold my arms farther than shoulder distance apart to make space for my hips, but that lowers my height so that I can't get my legs off the ground. \n\nAny tall ladies have success with jump throughs that can give me advice?"

Active.\n\nI have a very tight lower back that causes me agro when I'm bending over to pick something up, moving positions whilst sat down and sometimes even walking. It's super tight to the point where standing back up straight had to be done slowly and smoothly, it's not severe pain like breaking a bone it's more of an uncomfortable radiating stiffness that just slows my manoeuvrability.\n\nIt started around 4 months ago after I was surfing and the pain came and went and only really returned when I surfed. I then decided to take up yoga as a remedy and the results are amazing, I have no back pain what so ever.\n\nHowever the new problem rises when I take a few days off the pain seems to return and comes on even tronger. Is this common? It's like my body is addicted to the yoga.\n\nI attend at least 3 times per week on average but often attend 4 Mon - Thu. Weekends I'm out surfing. \n\nNow I don't plan to attend this much forever as I have other hobbies to work at, yoga was just a short term whim really that I would like to drop down to once per week, although now i'm not sure if that will be enough.\n\nWhat are your opinions on the matter?\n\nThanks for any info on advance.\n\nUpdate: Attended a sports PT and he told me nothing serious is going on but the prolonged surf sessions has agitated a lower disk and my muscles are cramping up to protect it. \n\nAdvised me to follow a few lower back strengthening exercises per day and maintain good posture. It should at least start clear up in the next couple of weeks. \n\nMobility is my friend and that Yoga should be continued at least twice a week.\n\nGood feedback really.\n\nThanks."

      "reddit": "This seems to be a theme today with my clients so I thought I'd take a moment to reflect on it. Yes, the goal of yoga is to quiet the mind but that is not only for stress relief. It's much bigger than than that. Yoga today is about feeling good, relaxing and finding some time for ourselves in this very hectic society and lifestyle we find ourselves in. However, that is not the reason we practice.\n\nIn the yoga practice we do many things to help improve our physical and mental well being. What we are really after is that sense of peace and freedom we have when we end the lesson in sivasana, or the corpse pose. That alone is to make us embrace our mortality which is already work enough. It is supposed to give us a sense of separation from the body. This is not your body nor is it your mind. They are vehicles alone. In the corpse pose we are supposed to realise this. Here we are supposed to be able to completely separate from the flesh and connect with the spirit.\n\nOnce we can embrace that concept then we can look further to see the True Self as something completely different than these bones, flesh and thoughts that we have. That's the person we are trying to connect with. That is our own little piece of God right inside of us.\n\nWhen we are able to make this connection, it is ever so brief. You get this overwhelming sense of calm. You realise nothing else matters and you are content and happy with things just as they are. That's what it feels like to be connected with your True Self.\n\nThe more you practice the easier it is to get into that space, to reconnect with who you truly are. The longer you are able to stay in this space the stronger the connection becomes  and the easier it is to return to it in the future. This is where we truly reside, hence the body being only a vehicle, and in this space we can learn to hear and feel what we really want and who we really are.\n\nWe feel lost or uncertain only because we have lost the connection to reality by outside stimuli and the senses. Before we become active members of society, and live as free spirits (children), we live through this awareness of who we truly are. Then everything on the outside is exciting, amazing and wonderful. Thats why kids are so nice to be around. They live in the present more than we can ever hope for as adults. Society, responsibility and over stimulation take us away from our true nature. In doing yoga all we wish to do is to bring ourselves back to that natural state that we have lost.\n\nIt sounds easy but its a quest that we will be on for the rest of our lives. Thats why its called a yoga practice."

      "reddit": "I'm a new yoga teacher who just started teaching 3 morning classes/week at a gym. So far I love it...there is a large group of dedicated students that make it to every single class of mine, and so far it's gone really well. I learn something new every single class and look forward to gaining more experience as time goes on.\n\nHowever, there's this one student in particular who seems to find issue with almost everything--I was actually given a heads up about this student before I ever met them, as they are \"known\" at the gym for their constant complaints. I was advised by my boss to not take any of it personally or too seriously, because that's just how this person is.\n\nWell, right away I knew who this student was because sure enough, I had a flood of commentary from them at the end of the class--however, this student has now told me on multiple occasions that they really enjoy my class, so that made me feel amazing! If the notorious complainer likes my classes, that's an accomplishment, right?\n\nAnyway, after class the other day, this student approached me to complain about how obnoxious they find the other students...most of the class has attended yoga together for over a decade, so the minutes before class are often spent chatting. According to this student, it comes across as \"bar room banter,\" obnoxious, and far too loud for yoga. While I personally don't find the other students too loud, and know that this particular student is very opinionated, I also want EVERYONE to feel welcome in my class. So this morning, I made an attempt to quiet things down before class started by suggesting that everyone get into a comfortable position on their backs in preparation for centering. This helped a little, but not everyone quit chatting and the student who complained to me spent several minutes literally shushing everyone in the room. So I wasn't surprised when, after the class, they complained again about other students talking before class. The student said they love my class, the pacing and flow, etc...they actually said it's PERFECT for them, but that the other students \"totally ruin it.\" They did mention that they noticed how I got the class into a supine posture before class started, but basically implied that wasn't enough. They then went on to kinda sorta lecture me about how control of the class is part of teaching, that they're a teacher too (a school teacher, not a yoga teacher..prob important to make that distinction!), and that what I should specifically do is tell them to \"pipe down\" (exact phrasing here) and/or make them do a breathing exercise before class starts, specifically one \"where their tongue is on the roof of their mouth so they are physically unable to speak.\"\n\nMy friends, I was kind of flabbergasted at this point. So here is my thing. I realize that this student is a bit...special. It doesn't help that I personally don't find the noise levels to be unreasonable before class, especially since this is absolutely never a problem once the class itself begins...everyone gets into \"yoga mode\" right away and we're in that mode all the way through. However, like I said earlier in this post, it's really important to me to make sure that EVERY student is comfortable in my class. Short of rolling into the studio on Monday and telling everyone to \"pipe down,\" I guess I'm looking for a happy medium, if that makes sense??? I'd love for this student to NOT feel like class is being ruined for them, but I also am not really willing to stoop to the level of a third-grade teacher lecturing an unruly class that honestly isn't even unruly.\n\nI actually am not against a breathing exercise before the start of class, as this student mentioned..I guess the issue with that is, the yoga class is scheduled at a set time. Who am I to determine what the students do before that set time? It's a small gym, too, so having students congregate outside the studio room beforehand to do their chatting doesn't make sense nor do I think that type of congregation is even encouraged for safety reasons. Is it out of my bounds to ask students to do a breathing exercise before the class even begins?\n\nObviously, this is a thing I will be bringing up with my boss the next time I'm there, but since I have the weekend off to ponder this, I figured I'd see what my Reddit yogis think :) Any suggestions???\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Just want to thank everyone so much for responding!!! Basically everyone here is on the same track I was already on, so I feel better knowing my gut was going in a reasonable direction haha. Thanks again!"

I want to improve my flexibility for injury prevention and martial arts. So just wondering is it still possible for a 16 year old to start stretching and become flexible or age has nothing to do with it?\n\nanyways i'd like to improve leg flexibility specifically, wanna be able to do the splits and kick high. I stretch on average about 45-60 minutes a day (just started yesterday) while holding each stretch for a minute. Will that be enough or will i need to stretch more?\n\nthe thing is i already go to a gym regularly and has gained pretty decent strength and some muscle mass at least for a 16 yr old. I'm wondering is gaining flexibility harder than gaining strength or is it about the same difficulty? Cuz I'm thinking to myself if i can get decent strength then i should be able to become flexible lol\n\nanyways yea, just ANY advice is welcome, i've been avoiding this problem for a while now but now i really want to get flexible, thanks"

I have often taken the arms off my chairs but the base of the chair is usually too small or too curved to let me sit comfotably. I have pondered it myself for a while now but I thought I might as well consolt the experts ;). While I want to keep this general for others, I am 6'1'' so big is prefered and a back while not nessary would be a welcomed addition.\n\nThank you for any help Rendered,\n\nNargodian."

I mainly practice vinyasa, and tend to go to one or two instructors, so I'm sure I only know a tiny percentage of what is out there. \n\nThanks!"

      "reddit": "Sure, I can describe it.  Sorry if this is a bit long.  \n\nIn the vipassana retreat, I had a sort of breakthrough quasi-psychedelic experience on the 7th day (with a few smaller experiences in the days leading up to it, including lucid dreaming and hyperreal visual acuity).  It went something like this: without warning, I felt enveloped in a blue \"light\".  I was immersed in a profound (even supernatural) peace and happiness.  A ball of energy seemed to rise up from my perineum/crotch area and spread upwards to my head, seeming to gently force my head back and my mouth to open, as if this energy was exiting, or as if I was receiving something.  A large flower seemed to open up where I sat, stretching from my solar plexus to where my butt touched the floor (something I previously had thought was just a symbolic flourish in eastern religious art, but this seemed to be literally happening).  I ejaculated slightly without orgasming (sorry if that's a little gross or unwanted info).  I was flooded with the understanding that this is a state I or anyone else could experience at any moment, if we so chose, and we could all emerge from our suffering together.  Then the sit ended and the experience was over.\n\nA few years later, I was diagnosed with spinal arthritis, and in the midst of a total freakout, my wife encouraged me to meditate.  I had a full-blown experience, an absolutely ecstatic awakening of unitary consciousness, and a kind of filling up of my body with energy that was radiating from my belly and below.  It was a religio-mystical experience of remembering my true nature (it actually seemed like there was an intuition of a \"voice\" that asked me if I would \"like to remember\").  I was engulfed in all-encompassing love, compassion and forgiveness for everything that exists, and all the while my perception of self and reality seemed to fractal like a mandala.  There was no difference between what was inside and outside of me, eyes open or closed.  Physical pains, old grudges, and difficult memories that arose became gateways into deeper unfolding, and then the pains vanished. It was all love, and it was infinite and safe.\n\nThere was one thing that was particularly weird about this: while it was happening, every time my wife looked at me, she would kind of pass out.  She asked me why that was happening, and to my mind at the time, the answer was apparent; she was unconsciously attuning to my energy, but she was doing so in the way one ordinarily accesses this kind of dreamlike state: by sinking into sleep.  Also, when I spoke to her, my voice seemed to deepen, and I understood that when I typically talk with her (or anyone), it's like I am putting on a mask of personality that is perhaps flimsier than my \"true\" self.\n\nSince then, I've had regular experiences that are similar, but not usually (but sometimes) quite as laden with information; more typically, it's mostly a physical/energetic experience where it will rise up from my lower belly/perineum area and gently force my head back; I'll also go into at least a shallow trance where I may or may not have some insights.  I've become fairly adept at entering these states at will, and it will happen almost without fail during meditation and sometimes in yoga class.\n\nIt's been weird."

Is it safe to continue with handstand practice or pull-up movements?\n\nI will go easy on wrist heavy asanas this week. I’m currently taking teacher trainer daily, so it’s not possible to just totally stop and rest. Thank you !"

But I don't know if it's because my flexibility needs some work (I'm moderately flexible) or my body proportions are off (torso on the shorter side, with longer legs). I know I have the core strength to do it. Honestly it feels like my legs are too long or something. I figure if it really is my body proportions, then it likely won't ever be possible for me and I don't want to waste the effort. But if it's a simple fix, I'd love to hear some advice! Anybody else ever had this problem?"

I want to keep practising my asana's, they're doing my back a world of good. \n\nWithout a teacher to show me and correct me, I'd like to have a book I can use to stay fresh on each position and as a reminder for which muscle groups each asana focuses on.\n\nIn this particular case, I'm not too interested in the philosophical side of yoga. Just a practical guide with a step by step of important asanas and an explanation on which parts of the body they're supposed to stretch or strengthen. Additional information on how to do simplified versions of asanas I can't quite manage yet is also welcome.\n\nSo if you have any recommendations let me know."

In prenatal classes instructors often seamlessly make those modifications to poses so I'm not always aware that something is different for a specific reason. So I'm looking to learn more about specific things I MUST adjust when practicing on my own.\n\nBeyond issues of some things being not feasible or not comfortable (e.g. not lying on your back or needing a wider stance folds), are there certain movements or poses that are considered DANGEROUS in pregnancy? Or is it feasible to continue your regular practice and adjust by listening closely and seeing what feels right? \n\nThanks so much in advance for your advice and input!"

It's not really noticable anytime except when I do sulpine poses... I'm wondering if anyone knows what it is and if I should get it looked at"

I was experiencing acute shoulder pain elsewhere before). My DD now resembles the second pic here (of another yogi redditor):\n\nhttps://imgur.com/zriFAK9\n\nHOWEVER. I cannot stop experiencing pain in my left deltoid -- pretty much the area between the bicep and tricep. It's ONLY the left one, and it's only when my practice includes downward dog. The pain is a dull, bothersome ache and is very tender to massage. Pain flares after doing a few DDs. An instructor said this was probably because I was engaging new muscle groups and it would go away in time. It's been about 3-4 months of 1-4x/weekly practice and continues to be a problem. The pain goes away within 2-3 days of no DD.\n\nMy left shoulder IS less mobile than my right, but not absurdly so.  Any ideas?"

There are lots of things in my body I can focus on: the weight of my body pushing down on the ground, the feeling of my muscles holding a pose or stretching, the movement of breathing and the flow of my breath through my body, the warmth of the sun on my skin, the feeling of my clothes on my body, and so on. I just try to notice whatever is in my body that is the most easy to put my attention on. I have been doing this for quite some time now and it has become a lot easier with practice. :)"

Yoga classes vary tremendously in length and intensity, so while some classes are vigorous enough to help with weight loss, others are not, though they may offer an array of other benefits.\n\nIf you're interested specifically in weight loss, I recommend looking into vinyasa classes. These classes typically repeat somewhat vigorous sequences and move practitioners on and off the floor, which is a full body movement.\n\nMost yoga classes do not raise the heart rate high enough to offer much cardiovascular work (yes, there are exceptions, but most do not). It would be a good idea to, with the guidance of your doctor, develop a separate cardio routine to complement your yoga practice."

I put my foot behind my head during my yoga practice and I think that I put too much pressure on some nerves and then I stayed in this position for too long (30-60 seconds). I realized immediately after this that it somehow felt numb. It's only a small part of my calf, just the region that was touching the back of my head. I thought that with time it will be better, but it's the same. I have no problem walking, doing sports or anything, but when I touch the skin at this particular point of my calf, it just feels \"weird\". Has any of you had an experience like this? If so, how long did it take for the numbness to go away? Is there any treatment?"

How can you become a certified yoga instructor from an online course? I'm a big fan of online learning - I've done many courses through universities, Udemy, and other websites. But I can't help feeling some human interaction is required to become a yoga instructor - some hands-on interactions with other people. How are you meant to teach adjustments via a computer / video!\n\nTo me these kinds of programs are dangerous, and devalue regular yoga teacher training. And I don't care if you've got a PH.d!"

I can feel the floor beneath me, supporting me. I can feel my body pulsating to the rhythm of my heart beat. I exhale. A bead of sweat rolls between my parted lips and finds its home on my tongue. It tastes good. I wipe the sweat from around my mouth and return my arm to the floor beside me. My mind is clear but for the sounds and sensations in this place, in this moment. I feel each baby hair on my upper lip and chin release itself from my skin to stand at attention once more. The door of this room opens. I can hear the soft padding of bare feet. The door closes. I wiggle my toes to prove they’re still there. I press my shoulders into the floor. A breath of cool air tickles my toes. It moves ever so slowly up my leg, as if it knows it’s not supposed to be here. Not in this room. And then it is gone. Was it ever there? A figment of my imagination? I inhale. I thank my body for the work it has done. I exhale.\n\nShavasana"

Learn that really well and bring it to your one leg balance poses, with one leg. As soon as you lose Tadasana leg you have lost the pose. Attempting more at that point will only causes problems.\n\nE: Definitely use the wall or chair in the balance poses just a little to learn this. So you can really concentrate on maintaining that proper use of the leg."
